## 📄 Abstract

This study analyzes online discourse in the r/womenintech subreddit to assess patterns of toxicity and emotional expression over time. We employed NLP techniques and the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) framework to guide our analysis. Our results reveal temporal trends and emotional nuances in discussions within a safe space for women in tech.

##  💾 Dataset
The dataset includes Reddit posts and comments from the r/womenintech subreddit collected over a one-year period. Personal information has been removed or anonymized where appropriate. Data files are located in the dataset/ folder.

## 🧪 Methods
* GQM Framework for defining research questions
* Text classification using transformer-based models for emotional content
* Toxicity detection based on fine-tuned models and lexicons
* Temporal analysis to examine fluctuations over time
* Statistical analysis and visualization using Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)


## 📈 Results
Visual outputs such as time-series plots and emotion distributions are available in the graphics/ folder. These figures were used in the paper to illustrate key findings.
