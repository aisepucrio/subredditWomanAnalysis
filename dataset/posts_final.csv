One time, a man at work asked me to set a meeting, so I started sharing my screen and offered to show him how, and he said “oh no, I know how” so I stopped sharing and said “great, so if you have any questions setting that meeting just let me know” 

He never asked me to set a meeting for him again. 

Most recently last week, in a meeting I’m telling the programmers “all of these types of tickets need to need to be peer reviewed” I said it TWICE, then at the end of the meeting this guy asks what he needs to do, I tell him again, and he asks me to make a list of the numbers and send it to them. I said “if you filter for this, this, and this, all of these tickets will be there” 

*crickets* for almost a full 2 minutes, until I put myself on mute, then he finally says “okay” 

I can’t. I used to be really willing to help out, but I’m done helping people who make more than me, have the same job title as me, and do less work. ",user_2,5001,396

Kieran Snyder, cofounder and data analyst for Textio, tells Fortune this has largely to do with managers’ unconscious bias—women are judged more critically, and on a more personal level than men. “It’s a pattern that is not often checked,” she says. 

Rather than being given positive or even constructive feedback, top female staffers often experience unfavorable assessments, and they’re more likely to be judged on aspects of their social presentation. About 88% of these outstanding women workers receive feedback on their personalities, while the same is true for only 12% of their male counterparts, according to the report. 

“Men are mostly receiving feedback about their work. They’re developmental observations, they’re constructive. And then when you look at women, the positive observations are not generally about the work. They’re about the woman’s demeanor, personality, or disposition,” says Snyder. “We tend to relate to women in the workplace based on how they make the people around them feel, rather than the work that they’re doing. That means we comment on how friendly, collaborative, difficult, and likable they are. Those qualities don’t necessarily relate to the quality of the work that she’s doing.”

The report also finds that working women’s feedback is also often highly unactionable, meaning that criticism isn’t meaningful, or it’s unclear on what improvements need to be made. For every 1,000 words during a performance review, women experience twice as many instances of poor quality critiques compared to men. Snyder says this is a result of the laser focus around female staffers’ personalities. For example, performance reviews may revolve around a woman “being a joy to work with” instead of the success of the big project she just delivered. 

Aside from actively hurting women, these lackluster feedback mechanisms can also spell big trouble for bosses. The report shows that low-quality feedback damages employee morale, especially for high-performers who thrive on growth and improvement. About 40% of top workers who get inactionable criticism plan to leave their companies, compared to just 22% of successful employees who get actionable assessments. 

“High-performers are pretty ambitious people. So if you’re providing feedback that is not specific, not actionable, and you’re not promoting them, they will leave. These are people who are being recruited all the time—they have lots of choices for where to work,” Snyder says.

While it may be tempting to throw bias training at bosses and call it a day, Snyder says that isn’t a very effective course of action. She agrees that there should be some element of coaching—since most managers aren’t formally taughthow to lead—but that employers should also invest more in their people department. That means filling out your HR ranks, and dedicating time for more consistent and thoughtful performance reviews. Because when bosses are stretched thin, they don’t have time to cover all their bases. 

“Your average HR VP is supporting hundreds of managers. So when you get to feedback time, they focus on the most sensitive situations,” she says. “There are too many managers who need support, too few HR people, and employees tend to be on the receiving end of this bad system.”",user_3,4278,327

What he interrupted me with was, “You’re going on maternity leave?”

I love tech, I love my career path, but I'm so done fighting for my seat at the table that I've already earned several times over. 

I've been at my workplace for about 7 years. I'm good at my job, I've had consistently great feedback from everyone I work with. But every time a new guy joins at roughly the same seniority level as me they make a concerted effort to push me out, exclude me from meetings I need to be a part of to do my job well, and take over pieces of my job they think should be theirs. It's happened no fewer than 4 times in 7 years and here I am again, nearly 20 years in IT and I have to start this fight all over again because a new guy got appointed to a position peer to mine and he thinks I should be subordinate to him. 

I'm exhausted, and this is why there are so few women in tech because we don't just have to put effort into doing our jobs but we also have to put effort into being *allowed* to do our jobs. You'd think after 20 years in the industry and 7 years at this company that I'd be done, but it's just so consistently unwelcoming to women it's impossible to thrive.

I don't even know what career I'd go into because IT is what I want to do. I just want to give up.

Edit: thank you all for the support, it's both reassuring and disheartening to know I'm not alone in this experience. Part of the reason I opted to go into a tech leadership role instead of purely technical is because I wanted to help remove this barrier for more women to get into the industry. I know I'll probably stick it out, though I know this isn't unique to this company so I'm hesitant (but not necessarily opposed) to finding another job. I'm just tired, y'all :(",user_5,2146,197

FREAKING NAIL THEM! Sir yes sir I live and breathe for this job, this job is the most important in my life, I will give you my firstborn, although what am I saying, I refuse to have a family because it will distract me from my job. Yes, I will work 24/7. Yes, I will do whatever it takes. 

And I did all those things. Like an idiot. 

And then I turned 34 and just lost the ability to take on the amounts of abuse and everything went to shit. I quit, I took a break and I can't get back into the grind mentality. I now ask actual questions in my interviews.

How many nights and weekends does this work require really? What happened to the person who did this job before me and can I speak to them? No, this clearly isn't a new project and isn't a new role. What resources are available to me in this role and what are the steps to resolution YOU take to help me when those resources aren't available? How do you (my boss) work with other people on this team and what kind of relationship do you typically like to build? Where can I count on you and where can I not? 

I literally ended up talking myself out of a job offer last week. HR said they're willing to proceed, I ask for one more call with the boss and ask him all those questions. I tell him I'm looking for the right long term role for myself, for stability and those things are important to me. I interview HIM. Because in the last 4 rounds everyone has been asking ME questions and I still know absolutely nothing about the role. 

He didn't like it. He gave me half assed answers, the ones that don't get you hired. I kept pushing for specifics. Oh, also, he took the call from a cab on the way to the airport. How unprofessional. Half way through the conversation he got out of the cab, was grabbing his bags and rambling. What the hell. 

I texted after that I'm not confident I'll have everything I'll need to succeed for the goal that they gave me. I will need XYZ resources, XYZ people and XYZ time from him. His response was ""we're looking for someone very skilled to complete the goal in the next 12 months"". 

Past me would have said SIR YES SIR and then I'd be willing myself 24/7 high and dry. But this time I didn't. So I probably didn't get the job.

The vast majority of the engineering organization outside my team is also all male. I have been working on the same team for over a year. 

I told my manager about my pregnancy a couple of months ago, but I have been putting off telling my team. The men on my team are generally terrible at talking about non-work things, and it just sucks every time I share anything remotely personal and they don’t react at all. 

My manager has been asking me when I am going to tell the team, and in the last couple of weeks I have had some pregnancy-related complications that have required more time away from work for medical appointments, so I decided to be up-front about why I was missing some meetings.

So in a meeting today, it was my turn to give my weekly update and I said “hey, I wanted to let you all know that I am five months pregnant. I’m really excited about the pregnancy, but I have been having some ups and downs with it recently, so this is why I might be offline a little more over the next couple of weeks.”

And then… nothing. Radio silence. They all just stared at me. After a few seconds, someone said “okay then, who wants to go next?”

Honestly, this is the reaction I expected. This is why I don’t share personal stuff at work, because getting zero acknowledgement that I said anything at all just feels bad! I wasn’t expecting these men to throw me a baby shower or anything, but a single “congratulations” or “thanks for sharing” or “I hope things are going okay!” would have felt so much better than nothing. 

Is this normal?? I personally haven’t experienced this level of indifference on any other teams I have worked on, but I have historically worked at smaller companies. This is definitely the most corporate and most male-dominated job I have ever had. Why are men like this?

UPDATE

I didn’t expect this post to get as much attention as it did, and I’m having a hard time keeping up with replies. I appreciate a lot of the responses I have been getting to this, but if I may, I do want to clarify a couple of things. 

I have been working as a software engineer for ten years, and my previous job was as an elementary fine arts teacher. Believe me when I say I am VERY WELL AWARE of the differences between these two fields and the differing cultural expectations that come with working in tech, especially here on the West Coast of the USA (My company has a large international workforce, but my immediate peers are mostly based in California and Washington). If I wasn’t expecting to be different from most of my peers, I wouldn’t be here. 

I have had previous engineering jobs where I have worked with smart, empathetic, and, yes, sometimes neurodivergent people. But since I started my current job, I have dealt with a lot more sexist attitudes, coworkers who talk over me in meetings, and awkward interactions like this one that just leave me second-guessing myself and feeling like I don’t belong. I know I’m a little jaded, but at this point, it’s hard to believe it’s all unintentional. 

In the past year, I have had multiple deaths in my family, layoffs and financial stress, and now this pregnancy. As much as I would like to just focus on work and not ever talk about the things that are affecting my life outside of it with the people I spend multiple hours with every single day, that’s just not always possible! And believe me, I have tried. 

I know that I’m not wrong for wanting more from my coworkers, even if they are tech workers.  I’m not really looking for “don’t take it personally” kind of advice, but I do appreciate hearing that I’m not the only one who has been through something like this! I plan to leave this job as soon as I can after maternity leave, but in the meantime, it really does help to talk about it! It’s clear that not everyone here agrees with me on this, but sometimes talking about your experiences and feeling empathy from other people can help you feel less weird and alone.",user_9,1773,361

When I started job hunting for my first gig I was recruited by a number of tech companies. I made it relatively far into the interview process for Lyft, Google and Pinterest. I was humiliated by two out of the three for bombing the in-person round, and was crushed. Google even told me to spend a year or two studying before they ever called me back again. 

I was able to land a gig at a small healthcare startup, job hopped a bit and settled into a couple other gigs. Was recently laid off by a company I worked at for 3 years, and once again was crushed. I experienced a lot of micro-aggressions, underestimations of my intelligence, rejection… basically a great festering ground for imposter syndrome soup. There were so many times where I thought I just wasn’t smart enough to write code. I was never really good at math, and problem solving was a skill I had to develop over time. Like, maybe I’m just NOT good and I should just give up on trying to build a career in tech even though I find a lot of joy in programming and learning new things.

I almost gave up completely, but then decided that if this is my passion I should pursue it with integrity, so I decided to go back to school to prove to myself that I actually am intelligent and capable. I’m currently in the process of getting my masters degree in CS at a top 5 ranked school and I’m averaging a 3.7/4 gpa. Going back to study CS traditionally has completely reversed all of the things I felt about myself before. Can’t do math? Actually, with some real time and effort I can actually do it very well. It isn’t rocket science to me anymore. CS concepts like Big O finally feel accessible to me. These interviews are starting to feel a lot less intimidating. 

I don’t care what anybody says about how useless getting a masters is or whatever for the industry. I’m damn proud of myself 🥹 and I love what I do even more now. ",user_10,1720,114

My body, confidence, style, and the way I present myself have all changed significantly. However, while my appearance has changed, my skills and performance at work remain consistent.

Despite this, I’ve noticed a distinct shift in how I’m treated, especially as the only female engineer on my team. Before my transformation, my contributions were appreciated, and my ideas were heard and respected. Now, I find that my thoughts are often met with contrarian responses, even when I’m obviously correct. I have to go out of my way to explain or prove myself, which is mentally exhausting, other engineers don't have to prove every statement they say in meetings. 

This change in behavior feels tied to my physical transformation, which my male colleagues have commented on (""oh wow you lost weight""). Their treatment includes subtle actions like excluding me from conversations, assigning work among themselves without my input, blindsiding me in meetings, and failing to keep me in the loop about basic updates. I constantly have to chase out information from them, it feels like I am in the boys club, I never felt this way when I was bigger.

Another woman on the team (though not an engineer) has noticed the shift and has been supportive, which I appreciate. However, these ongoing dynamics have been challenging. With the current job market, switching jobs isn’t a simple option, and there’s no guarantee that another role wouldn’t bring similar issues. It’s disheartening to see such a change in behavior solely based on appearance, and I’m struggling to navigate this dynamic.

Is this my new reality as a ""thin"" woman who's more conventionally attractive in tech? When I was bigger, I didn't stand out and male engineers seemed more comfortable around me. Other male engineers who are not in my direct team look/stare at me a lot, which I can ignore the male attention, the issue is how the engineers in my direct team behave around me.

I’ve had to take on a persona where I can’t be my “natural” self and need to be “on” all the time. My definition of “on” is not to smile as much (unless I know this colleague and have established an understanding and healthy level of work trust), have my deeper voice “on”, and not laugh (I already don’t do this too much unless it’s people I’ve worked closely with but still at a professional level). Unfortunately, identity politics is real. They’ll see a baby face Asian woman and assume I’ll be quiet, submissive. I’m not like that at all (professionally and personally), so when I do speak up or state my boundaries, or assertively but politely decline someone giving me their job, people get very offended, as if they expect me to say “yes” to them. 

Lately, I’ve learned to stop raising my hand on zoom unless I need to wait in line for a team meeting where 2 colleagues are just rambling. 

Other things I’ve had to “un-learn” and learn:
- stop going above and beyond. I still had my strong work ethic in grad school but in the corporate world, no one cares 
- don’t always be too dependable , they’ll give you more work
- even if you’re available, don’t fill in or help out a bad coworker, you’ll be their “go to” for everything 
- it’s all about socializing and looking pretty. Lucky for me I can kind of socialize and put makeup on and I’m good. When we go into the office, I stress on these pointers than actual send out emails all day
- nepotism always wins, your hard work doesn’t matter 
- quiet quitting isn’t actually quiet quitting- it’s just doing the minimum. Your brain has trained you to be a “boss lady” and go above and beyond and if it’s affects your mental health, stop.

Eventually, he gave me a proper apology and then followed it up with a large apologetic message via socials. I left it at that.

However, I do feel as though I could have handled the situation better. What are your tips and tricks for turning this behaviour back on these guys, and making them feel it is entirely inappropriate?",user_21,994,277

I'm a mid-40s single mother with an advanced degree. It came out of the blue, although tensions had been brewing with my manager from the start in mid 2023. 

He's always said, and would bring that up, that my technical acumen was never in doubt. I work hard, I try to be inclusive and kind, and I loved the work I was doing. So why was I fired? The ""tensions"" were around how I wasn't living up to his expectations for my role, because he thought I needed to be ""more aggressive"" with others. In the most recent example, he was upset that a team mate junior to me got a seat at the table and not me. He thought I should raise hell to his manager and above and demand it. Said I was ""too worried about stepping on toes"" when I told him that this woman was doing a good job, that I was overflowing with immediate needs, and that I was still providing guidance for the project.

  
It was a double whammy with him. On one hand, he'd say I needed to ""be aggressive"" and force things to happen when I wasn't the decision maker. He'd say he'd support me. But then he ultimately wouldn't support me, like when I made small technical decisions that a junior member of another team didn't like. 

We've had these discussions periodically, and every time he'd come back and apologize for being too harsh. I think what freaked him out was that when I pushed back this time, I sent him that article about overachieving women having their personality criticized over performance.  I told him that I wasn't happy with his behavior and that I had no qualms about leaving if we couldn't figure things out. 

It's still confusing to me, though, because I thought he was a good guy.... \[Plot twist\]....and  as dumb as it sounds, I was also attracted to him when I thought he was kind and reasonable. I never acted on it, but I think he knew. 

So I guess he broke up with me before I broke up with him \[laughing emoji\]. 

  
Last words: The irony is that I was just going to have a conversation with him about how my overflowing work load needed to be adjusted because I can't keep living with the go-go-go stress. So in some ways, this is what I wanted. It's still painful and confusing, though.",user_22,969,158

As well, those saying to respect and not diminish the support people have for the shooter because it finally brought a voice to those who had to suffer under the company’s system. It truly was posted to be controversial in conversation and has no reason to be interacted with in the first place.

It is disappointing truly that this situation had to occur to finally spark the discussion on balance of healthcare in the US. Tie into the conversation that people are disappointed that this has sparked a class war and shows how tired people are of its system. Can we not acknowledge we too are tired of the system not acknowledging our voices in tech, which are overshadowed too by the groups placed on society. It’s a privilege really to not be upset by the outcomes present, but I truly don’t agree with those who are in full support of one over the other when there are the costs of people’s lives in between.

So basically, everyone in the office sits with their backs to him except for me, who sits facing *his* back and can see his screensaver head on. There is a woman who sits directly across from him though. She’s also not on my team, but I’m thinking of talking to her.

What are yours?

1. Be wary of the 30-year-old (or younger) VP. There are exceptions of course, but many didn't get to this role by their own merit.\*
2. Be also wary of those promoted to leadership after mass layoffs.
3. HR is NOT your friend.
4. HR will not help you, unless you have a champion who is advocating for you at the leadership level. (see #1)
5. If your boss quits, and their boss quits, it's time for you to start thinking about quitting.
6. Culture is what your leaders protect and reward. If bullies and creeps are protected and rewarded, you have yourself a toxic culture.
7. Your mental health will take a hit if you're working in a toxic culture. Quit while you still trust your own abilities.
8. Trust your own abilities.
9. Lovely, functional workplaces **do** exist. Despite the prevailing rhetoric (""choose your shit show""), and the prevalence of misogyny in our field, there ARE places that protect, promote, reward and support women.

*(\*I apologize if this comes off as ageist. I am a millennial and have met many capable folks younger than me. I even had a director 10 years younger whom I loved.

To add to all of the below insanity, I have just realized that the client in question is very likely attempting something unethical. It’s likely related to fear of election results somehow. And now I am scared in a much larger context. Because without realizing it or tying to I have shed light on it and questioned it. Not intentionally just trying to navigate my job and get it done covering for the upper managements failures!!!! Can this day get any worse????? Thank you unregulated capitalism.

UPDATE 2: today I just won emotional guy 1, emotional guy 2, AND the client. I better get a spot bonus AND a raise. I grew so much as a product manager today. I think I have outgrown this company, will publish a few linked in articles, as starting an AI research with a grad student at Cornell in parallel behind the scenes. I will be applying to other companies. I have not yet decided how to proceed with the ethical issue of emotional guy 1 and his infidelity. 


- - - - -

I am involved in a poor outcome situation with a difficult client at work. Closely involved are two men, one my boss and the other upper management. 

Both men are way too emotional. 

Emotional guy 1: upper management. Yelling at my boss and breathing down his back, 

Emotional guy 2:  taking the abuse by emotional guy 1, losing logical perspective over the situation and starting to yell at me while at the same time apologizing because 1) instinctively he realizes I’m right and I’m needed to solve the problem 2) it’s not in his nature to yell, he is just stressed and emotional 

Meanwhile all of this is the upper management guy failing to manage the client, him and his team failing to understand or follow our best practices which I have documented. 

At this point I am convinced he is a poor performer and hides his own failures by pointing the finger at others and yelling.

I almost want to get my emotional boss aligned and seeing the right way and exposing all of this to the CEO showing him where his “right hand” is dropping the ball and how his job can be done better. I don’t want his job, I just want him to do his job better. I can do it better than him but I don’t want it. 

And by the way, emotional guy 1 is also cheating on his wife who recently had a baby. Dude is a failure at work and home and he is moving throughout the world as a “successful” man. What a sham. ",user_34,750,87

That if you report what happened to you in the correct channels, they will punish the wrong-doer and all will be well. Of course, no one is pretending that sexism and harassment don’t happen - that would be impossible to sell. Girls that get cat-called at 14 will never believe that women don’t get sexually harassed in the workplace. But they might believe that it will be dealt with, if they go about reporting it in the right way, and are nice enough about it. 

In reality, the problem is not the misogynists. Or, it’s not the main problem - of course working in tech would be a better place for women if they were seen by all as true equals and not sex objects that can solve problems on the side. The actual problem, the reason why almost half of women leave their STEM careers within 5-7 years and why almost no women make it to the leadership positions is the enabler. 

The enabler is not a misogynist. The enabler knows that women are equally capable of technical excellence. The enabler would love if women didn’t experience sexual harassment in the workplace. They proudly wear the women’s employee resource group hoodie! The enabler just wishes everyone could focus on the technical problems in front of them. Why do we need to give any attention to the fact that Mark makes Jenna uncomfortable? He’s so good at delivering results! If the women could just shrug it off and get back to work, everything would go smoothly.

The enabler does not care if Jenna quits her job as long as it doesn’t get in the way of meeting the technical goal. The enabler will secretly be happy to watch her leave and will continue to support efforts to recruit more women to replace her, as long as those women know how to sweep the right things under the rug. 

The enabler can also be other women. Some women will be uncomfortable with women who speak their mind. They might compare their behavior to that of men, inadvertently shaming them for daring to speak out of turn. Once, I defended myself in a meeting against a man many years and many salary grades my senior. The main takeaway I had from that experience was a comment made by a woman who was in the room - “Sometimes I ask myself if I would be uncomfortable with a woman’s behavior if she were a man. In that situation, I would have still been uncomfortable.” Is it man-like to defend myself? If it is, isn’t that the problem? How can a woman ever be successful if she will be shamed for being confident and standing up for herself?

Perhaps the worst type of enabler is women like myself. The women who know what happens behind closed doors, but won’t speak out on behalf of others because she knows what will happen. She knows that selflessness is not rewarded in this environment. She will get labeled a “reporter” or “not a team player”. She knows that her current workplace is not an anomaly - she’s heard that they are all like this. She will be pushed out of the work that she loves doing when she’s not distracted by the anxiety of knowing that it’s only a matter of time until it’s her turn to be targeted. Because once she’s targeted, she will have to make a choice - to tolerate harassment or to sacrifice at the very least her current job, and at the most her entire career. 

TLDR: I'm an early-career female engineer struggling with how to cope with what I've observed in my first two years working and starting to feel guilty about it. Are all places insidiously toxic or did I get unlucky with my industry of choice (I'd prefer to not specify)?

I'm fucking tired of the unfair/biased social rules that are put on women that I know skip men.

I was at a work event that was concluding a two week long event at my company. I'm new to my job (I just started a few weeks ago) and did my best introducing myself to my team and all other coworkers. I was social and professional. When it came to work I proactively asked coworkers if I can join in on project meetings to get exposure, as long as there was room and it was appropriate. I can respect boundaries. 

Let me tell ya it certainly didn't run both ways. I was not invited to anything. Coworkers, not even my actual teammates (who are all men btw), didn't really approach me even if I was by myself. 

Whatever, it's work. We're not here to be besties, we're here to be a work team. 

Now why exactly did my boss tell me this? One of the events was a dinner at a restaurant. I was seated at my table with some of my team for most of the event. At some point everyone started to get up and move around/socialize. I grabbed a drink twice (many people were doing this so I thought it was ok). Both times a specific coworker joined me, the bartender was very slow so we were just chatting. we have very related roles and education so it was professional and friendly discussion - thank god I Was so tired of going up to people, try to strike a convo and then it turn dead without my prompt. like I can read social cues so I don't want to bother people and as an introvert it's really energy draining. 

I spoke with other people but everyone was really mingling and busy. I thought it was a great event and everyone was jolly. 

During a call my boss was talking about the event and I said it was great and food was good. Then he made a comment that he noticed I was at the bar a lot. It caught me completely off guard but thankfully I immediately gathered myself and said I didn't mean to be rude or unprofessional (I mean a lot of people were doing this). He then told me next time I should be more cognizant of who I'm talking to for how long. Aka I was talking to my coworker for too long ?? I told him I had been socializing all week and met a lot of people (all on my own I shall reiterate). 

He just repeated what he said and next time I need to talk to more teams instead of one coworker. 

What the fuck, we weren't canoodling in a corner! I feel like I was being accused of something else. 

I'm truly so embarrassed, I barely got off the call without crying. Thankfully my friend was able to give me some good advice but goddamn it really made me feel terrible. I was professional and kind/friendly to everyone. I was wearing a turtleneck, not tight jeans so I definitely wasn't dressed inappropriately. 

Apparently I was not demure or mindful!

Her story and my story are converging and it's killing me,"Background: My mom was an OG womenintech. She worked for a company in Redmond, Washington in the 1980s, which I believe was eventually bought by Microsoft. She would tell me how, before I was born, she was a floor supervisor (I think the equivalent today is Quality Assurance) for the motherboard line and she was responsible for making sure that everything making it out of the floor was up to snuff.

After a few years in that role she was instructed to train two new hires. Both young men. Long story short, after training these men for quite a bit of time, my mom was let go in a layoff. They restructured and one of the young men she trained was put into a role similar to hers as a floor supervisor.

It was the 80s and she experienced so much sexism and attempts at getting her to do sexual favors with management that she never wanted to work in tech again. She tried to follow her passion of working with horses for a few years before eventually having me and being a stay-at-home mom.

Now I work in tech as a full stack web developer and while I have experienced my share of sexism, that's not what this is about. My mom warned me about the cutthroat nature of tech, the bro culture, all of that.

This is about AI.

Does anyone else feel as if we are ""training our replacement""? I feel with each day that what I do is feeding in to the system that will make me obsolete. With every line of code I am shaving off a chunk of myself and feeding it to the machine. Soon I won't be anything.

That said, I don't recommend taking this route unless absolutely necessary. It's better to move on to a company where your contributions are valued. However, the job market has been tough, and this issue seems pervasive across the industry, so here we are.

What do they want?

The things I get argued on are just normal parts of doing my job, things that are normally quite uncontroversial. If I'm getting a paycheck, I'm obligated to do my job, right? So they can't possibly be expecting me to just... stop working, right?

In fact, I get a lot of pressure to deliver more than my male teammates, and faster, despite the extra hurdles I have to jump through. So that's not it.

I've wondered if these types of men are trying to get me to quit? But I've often found that when I bring up switching teams, they scramble to keep me, so that's not it either.

I'm experienced and my performance has always been good, so it's not like they'd have any reason to think I need to be aggressively corrected or anything.

Do they expect me to sense the exact way they want things done? If so, why do they understand that this is impossible when working with a man, but not understand that when working with a woman?

Or do they just want me around because they get a kick out of questioning me?

I recently read the biography of a mathematician who, at the age of 10, had his own lab and was already programming. By 16, he was winning top math competitions. Later, he attended a prestigious college, earning bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees. Eventually, he was hired by OpenAI and now earns millions of dollars.  

This made me wonder why there aren’t as many women excelling in STEM fields. I read an article that described how tech companies have evolved into what often feels like a “boys’ club,” with board members being overwhelmingly male. Most of the tech giants were founded by men.  

Men can dedicate their entire youth to their passions without hesitation.  

Society has taught women that their value is the highest when they are young and that they should prioritize finding a husband because their biological ability to have children is time-limited. Monthly menstruation serves as a constant reminder that they need to think about starting a family. Moreover, in society, young and attractive women are often considered more valuable, while life after 30 can feel overwhelming for many women because men may start viewing them as “too old.”  

As a result, women can’t fully immerse themselves in their passions and forget the world. Even when a young woman decides to pursue education or a career, she often has the nagging thought in the back of her mind that her time is limited, and she needs to make life decisions about family, finding a properly partner. And we know how difficult for women it can be. 

Men don’t face this same pressure. For men, studying and self-development in their youth is highly motivating because they don’t feel they are giving up anything. They believe that if they work hard, success will come, and their youthfulness or opportunities aren’t at risk.  

For women, it’s different. Women may wonder: If I study hard and become successful, I lose my youthfulness. Will I end up alone because men won’t find me attractive as I age?

Men, on the other hand, often feel more attractive as they get older. They become wealthier and view investing in their education as a long-term strategy with no downside. They see their rewards coming later in life.  

Additionally, I’ve observed that women put significant energy into finding the right life partner. Men, however, seem less cautious. Many will marry the first woman who gives them attention, without worrying too much about her personality or the possibility that she might be abusive or manipulative. They may even end up having a child with the wrong person and don't bother about it, because it will be a women how will have to spend time and take care of a baby 

Men often benefit significantly from having a wife. A woman provides emotional support, fulfills social needs, cooks, and cleans—essentially they gaining a free housemaid. 

But imagine a female scientist marrying a man. If she doesn’t cook for him or clean, the man might cause her more trouble than benefit. For a woman in a demanding career, a husband could feel more like a burden than a partner.  He will make constantly arguments about that she is too involved in her hobby.

I was in a meeting with one of our partners and our sales team—about 15 people total. I’m a senior software engineer, and I was there to help resolve an issue. As I was explaining something, my boss suddenly cut me off, literally yelling, “Stop, you don’t need to talk about that.” I stopped out of respect, but it was super awkward.

Later, as the meeting was wrapping up, one of the partners asked if our team could stay on the call, 3 of them from their group had stayed on. One of the guys had said “ Khaleesi (my fake name) was about to answer my question until the Night King (my boss’s fake name” put a brake on it. So I’d like Khaleesi to continue and proceed with what she was presenting earlier.” My boss stayed silent the entire time. Towards the end of the meeting, they told me that they believe that the solution I discussed would tremendously help them with automating a lot of their tasks on this project they’re working on and was grateful. They even said this is why we love GOT (my company’s fake name) because you bring so much to the table. Again, my boss never said a word so I figured I angered him. 

After the meeting, he called me and said he didn’t like how I presented things and was pretty upset about it. I’m not the type to argue, so I apologized and said it wouldn’t happen again. He also mentioned that my detailed monthly reports make the other engineers look bad because they have to put in more effort to match mine. I told him I’d keep my reports as short as he wants.

I’ve been in this role for about five years, and I’ve had three different bosses before this one from my previous positions. There’s a huge difference between them and my current boss. My previous bosses were super supportive, praised my work, and provided the resources I needed. This guy, though? Total opposite. He’s all about being the star, never checks in on the team, and expects us to figure out resources on our own. I’ve just learned to keep my head down and avoid being noticed.

A few months ago, at a corporate event, one of our big bosses praised me in front of him, saying I’ve leveled up and can take on some of his projects. I hated that because I don’t like the spotlight. My boss has embarrassed me in front of partners and clients multiple times. Once, after one of these incidents, one of the sales guys had asked if I was okay because I looked like I was about to cry. He mentioned that my boss’s behavior reminded him of a previous egotistic boss he didn’t get along with. I have to agree—my boss is very egotistic, always wants to be right, and enjoys embarrassing others when they don’t meet his standards. To be fair, he’s a smart guy but not good at managing people. He also doesn’t share the knowledge nor resources he has, he keeps them to himself.

I’m the youngest and the only woman on our team, and I’ve always tried to just be one of the guys, so I never complain about any negative behavior. I also don’t want to get anyone in trouble, so I’ve never gone to HR, nor will I. I hate to pull the woman card because I have had good experiences with my previous bosses who were all men & have been treated well on my previous positions but I feel like there are still men in IT who still  dislike women in this field and this is based off of my 10+ years in IT. This is my 1st job out of college, started from the bottom and worked so hard to get to where I’m at since I’ve always felt the need to prove myself in the male-dominated world of IT. 

Today, one of the engineers sent me a Zoom chat saying, “Try not to be in the spotlight too much because it puts pressure on the team.” I just laughed it off and responded, “Hahaha, I’ll do my best to stay out of the spotlight for you guys!” But honestly, it sucks feeling so alone on this team. It makes me feel like I have to dim my light, not work too hard, and just blend in so my boss and the team will like me. I guess this is just part of working in the corporate world.

Anyway, I’m just venting. Tomorrow is a new day. We all have our battles, and I’m choosing to focus on the positives in my life and have this mindset that other people have it worse… though sometimes I just want to cry and scream, but hey, that’s part of being human, right? 

EDIT:~~~~~~RESPONSE TO ALL~~~~~~~~~~

Hey everyone!
Wow, I'm honestly blown away by all the support and advice from this post. This is the first time I've done anything like this—I was just so frustrated all day and ended up posting before I crashed for the night. Thank you so much for all the love and encouragement! It really means a lot, and I'm beyond grateful.

Since I can’t reply to everyone individually, I just want to say that this whole experience has really opened my eyes. Before this position, I was fearless, and my previous bosses always had my back. I even won the highest excellence award of the year (which usually goes to a group of 5 people). I’m not saying this to brag, but just to show that my hard work used to speak for itself. But with this boss, it’s been tough from the start—there were red flags I definitely shouldn’t have ignored.

Honestly, I can’t put all the blame on him or the other engineers. I have to own my part in this too—I’ve let this go on for too long and allowed them to treat me this way. Maybe if I had stood up for myself sooner, it wouldn’t have gotten to this point. Instead, I kept telling myself things would get better, and I reprogrammed my mindset to just accept it. I became way too submissive & passive.

How I’ve coped? Hitting the gym almost every day and doing yoga has definitely helped me deal with it all and accept the situation as it is.

It’s true what they say: people quit their jobs because of managers, not the company. I love this company—I started at $11/hour and now I’m making something I’m really proud of. Pay-wise, I can’t complain, and I’ve always been loyal. But yeah, the suggestion to go back to my old division isn’t an option—it closed down due to COVID.

As for HR, this company is US-based but Japanese-owned tech company, so they’re super conservative. In the last 5 months, four account managers have quit because of management. One of them, who I’m pretty close with, said she reported things to HR, but they did nothing. So, when she got another offer, she took it, even w/ pay cut. Earlier this year, a sales manager sued the company for harassment; they settled, and it’s all hush-hush. So, unfortunately, reporting to HR isn’t really an option for me.

Finding another job wasn’t something I considered before—I wanted to stay, be loyal, and retire with this company. But now, I’m starting to see things differently. It’s easier said than done, though, especially with bills, a mortgage, and student loans. When I was younger, I could walk away from a job, but now it’s not that simple. And because of a noncompete agreement, moving to a partner or competitor isn’t an option.

To the women entering this field, please DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED by my situation. Learn from it, and don’t let anyone walk over you, even if you’re just starting out. Address things right away—don’t wait until it’s almost too late. I’ve had phenomenal bosses who showed me that being a woman in a male-dominated field isn’t always a bad thing.

So this morning, I got a surprise text from a former colleague, just randomly checking in to see how I’m doing. I’ve also been talking about all this with my SO, and he’s pretty much echoed what everyone here has been saying. Then, while chatting with one of my current colleagues (not about this situation), I was scrolling through our old messages to find some info on a client. I stumbled across an old exchange where he mentioned talking me up to my boss, and I responded with, “Remember, I don’t want to be noticed.”

Seeing that really hit me—I’ve changed so much that now I actively avoid attention, recognition, or the spotlight. And honestly, that’s not healthy at all. Maybe the Universe is really really trying to tell me something...

What am I doing now? I’ve started documenting and taking screenshots of any negative comments and keeping a record of every incident. Not to report to HR, but just to protect myself. If I do move on, I’ll bring it all to HR (not that it will do much), and I might even consider legal action. I’d hate to do that because I really do love this company, and they’ve helped me build a successful career, so we’ll see...

Again, thank you so much, everyone. You’re all so kind and supportive. To the women in tech who are excelling, standing up for themselves, and being brave—you’re amazing. Keep doing what you’re doing; you’re truly an inspiration.",user_53,575,193

My team is very diverse and many of them are top performers as well. I’m now very involved with DEI initiatives, including helping to make sure tech assessments are administered fairly. Talent exists in every group. Desirable employers will seek out diversity of talent, not diverse bodies to fill the roster.

I’ve been dealing with sociopaths at work for a while now, and they’re not who you might expect—they’re women. What’s even sadder is that, as women in tech, there aren’t that many of us to begin with, and instead of lifting each other up, some choose to tear others down. They isolate their victims, stir up drama, gaslight, and lie to get ahead, all while pretending to be on the same team.

I’m very good at psychology, so I see these behaviors clearly. I’ve tried to speak up, but all I get is the politically correct response—“Oh, it’s nothing, don’t take it personally.” But I’m done. It’s already tough for us women in tech, and it’s heartbreaking to see us working against each other like this. Enough is enough.

Now the industry and the pay (comparatively) suck.,"I’m so tired of working with people that went into tech for the money. A lot of which lack the fundamental interest in the work and the technical understanding required for advanced problem-solving. They get burnt out and I’m burnt out trying to compensate for others on my team. If I don’t assist them in their work, I look like I’m not a team player. 

But looking around for other jobs, I’m realizing that the job market sucks. They want people to have Masters degrees for business analysis. Software engineering roles are being listed at $75K per year. All these financial gurus on YouTube advised everyone to get into tech. And I cringe every time I hear someone suggest it. It’s not gonna pay that well if hundreds of people are applying for the same positions, and employers are finding many unqualified after the individuals are hired. Everyone studies for the interview. People fake it until they make it and then they’re like “Oh shit.” once they’re in the role.

I’m working with developers that don’t know how to make a webpage adjust to a user’s time zone. I told one of our support analysts to print a document to PDF and she told me she didn’t have a printer. I want to cry. You all would have a stroke if you knew some of the more specific details of situations I’m working with. 

I’m flustered. I worry that it’s just going to get worse from here and I’ll never see that $200K+ salary the elders in my company receive because so many people are vying for the same jobs and half of them don’t have a skill set that will cut it past the interview. My only hope of making that much is from the dollar depreciating and inflation getting out of control. 

So we’ll just be scraping by, barely meeting deadlines, build after build. Never having time to resolve technical debt, because everyone seems to be frickin winging it.

Do not get me started on the “over-employed”. Everyone but the managers know they have another job. People think they’re so clever and so good at hiding it here on Reddit. They’re not. They’re a drag on their team and are going to ruin wfh opportunities for everyone.

About 5 years ago, I worked for a tech ""startup"" that had about 300 employees. Using inverted commas because the company was about ten years old at that point and profitable. Everyone got together in-person for a company kickoff and as part of that, we had a diversity expert come in to present on inclusivity. 

One of the ""inclusivity"" exercises started with all 300 of us standing in a circle in a large room. The expert asked a series of questions and for each question where your answer was yes, you took a step forward towards the middle of the room.

Example questions were:

Have you ever experienced gender discrimination?

Have you ever experienced food insecurity?

Have you ever experienced housing insecurity?

At the end of the exercise, it was me and one other person standing in the middle of this huge event space with everyone else looking at us. I've never felt so called out and highlighted in my life! The opposite of inclusion. I still look back on that day and cringe.

I was a rockstar performer for my first few years and reached Senior level in under 5 years. Once I got to Senior, I was burned out, I slowly recovered over the past year and now I don’t have the same “junior” level of energy and drive to achieve and work hard for the next promotion. I’ve gotten pretty comfortable with my WFH situation and having a very hands off manager.

I used to always be an over achiever. High school valedictorian, went to a top university, got straight A’s, landed a job at a prestigious tech company right after graduation. 

I’m starting to feel like I’ve reached the plateau in terms of achievement. I don’t really want more responsibilities and dealing with corporate politics, or pursuing a manger track. But I also feel so weird not being on top of my A game and just being an average performer and kind of phoning it in at work. 

I’m a little shocked that I’ve already lost steam just 5 years into my career, but also can see myself just riding it out and collecting the paycheck. There are many people at my company who stay 10-20+ years, even just at Senior level.

I did that. My insecure toxic boss that doesn’t communicate with me really dialed it in with my annual review, then asked me to schedule a meeting with him to go through it. I instead requested we go through it with 2 directors, one is my director (his boss, also a blowhard), and another director I work closely with (who is amazing).

In this meeting, I sat at the head of the table and schooled all of them on what my job actually is, since none of them know how to do it. I listed numerous examples of my boss negatively impacting my work, and creating a hostile work environment, mentioned how I was demoralized, and how he was not meeting my expectations as a manager.

These 3 white men were spooked.

The next morning, the 2 directors called me back into the room and offered to help me open an HR investigation, and offered me a transfer to another division- reporting directly to that amazing director.

Thank you so much for sharing your stories. It gave me the courage, and sharp (but PROFESSIONAL!) wording to sort out this bs myself.

The tech industry has one of the largest representations of misogynistic men. I have been working in tech for many years, and my experiences have shaped this opinion.  

During my studies, I interacted with many of these men, and I can confidently say they were highly misogynistic. They would openly tell jokes about how women are less intelligent and make racist remarks about Black people—even some professors participated.  

Early in my career, they would make side jokes about women, even at work. Imagine how confident and entitled they must feel to not even be afraid of making such jokes.  
I don’t think it was specifically about me, because even if you watch or attend a tech conference full of men, you can sometimes hear how they refer to women. The internet is also full of examples showing their behavior and thoughts within their bro circles.

Moreover, I noticed that many of them lacked basic manners and cultural awareness. Poor hygiene was common—entering a classroom with 90% men often meant encountering unpleasant odors. Many couldn’t dress properly, had unkempt hair, and didn’t maintain a healthy physique or exercise.  
I thought this behavior might just be a phase during their student years, but after entering the workforce, little had changed.  

What’s more disturbing is their overconfidence. Many of them are incredibly mean, love showing off their knowledge, and frequently engage in mansplaining. They thrive on turning work into a competitive “rat race,” pushing themselves to take overtime and work beyond regular hours just to flaunt their productivity. Unfortunately, companies seem to reward this behavior, as it creates employees who deliver quickly, even at the expense of their own well-being.  

After working in tech, I can confidently say I would not want to marry a man from this field. Many are not only mean but also lean toward far-right beliefs, idolizing figures like Elon Musk and parroting his opinions.  

The worst part about being a woman in tech is how overwhelming the presence of these ""rat boys"" is. When there are only 2-3 women in a room filled with men, they stare at you constantly and often make jokes like, “Oh look, there’s a woman.” I once had a professor who would deliberately single out women during lectures.  

For instance, he would ask a question and specifically point at a woman to answer. There were about six women in the room, and he would repeatedly do this—ask a question, pick a woman to answer, then continue the lecture, only to ask another question and target the next woman.  

In a class where 90% of the students were men, he would address the group as ""gentlemen"" Instead of saying, ""Ladies and gentlemen, look at the board,"" he would simply say, ""Gentlemen"".


I don’t know why they behave so poorly towards women, lacking both manners and even basic hygiene.  

I could not imagine myself working in the kindergarden with those little babies.
I switched careers to a different field where the proportion of women to men is more balanced, and the men here are completely different. Professors in this field never say anything offensive to women, unlike those ""tech bros."" These men are well-mannered, dress more elegantly, and maintain better hygiene compared to the tech bros.  

It feels like part of being a tech bro is making fun of women.  

I worked at a company that marketed itself as one that supports equality and inclusion. And guess what? It was all nonsense. They would organize meetings to talk about equality, emphasizing how important it is, but they only invited women.  

For example, I was invited to a ""Women in Tech"" meeting, and most of the participants were women. The men didn’t attend. During these meetings, they would talk about how inclusivity is important—blah, blah. But why do I have to keep listening to this? I already know it because I don’t exclude anyone.  

Men should be the ones participating in these meetings because they’re the ones who apparently can’t treat people with equality and respect. Why are they making meeting with women and talk about equality? Organize these meetings for men and teach them.

If you make work your everything - you will have nothing left when it's gone. Storytime.  ,"I burned out REAL BAD 2 years ago after 15 years, with last 5 years working 80-100 hours a week. Granted, my career was going SUPER WILL those last 5 years, I got a VP title at 34. 

But after not having a single day off in those 5 years, sleeping 4 hours a day and having 1200 people reposting to me at some point, one day my mind just literally went blank. One day I found myself standing in the produce aisle of a grocery store for like an hour not understanding the difference between apples and tomatoes, trying to remember the last time I ate food. My mind just went beeeeeeeeep. So I was just standing there crying. 

Profit margins! Shareholder value! Being on 3 Zoom meetings at the same time 4 times a day. I just went blank. I quit right there and bought a one way ticket to an exotic country. That was 2 years ago, I haven't been home since. 

But now that I had some time to reflect, I'm so pissed! You know what killed me? Not having the support system. I'm single, I didn't have time to sleep, let alone date, and I don't have any family. I mistakenly thought that I will find that fulfilment and recognition at my job. Which for a while, I did! 4 promotions in 5 years! I've worked on the largest projects. As large as $1.6B! That was supposed to be success, right? 

All my colleagues were men in their 50s, and they lived on the same schedule, so I don't even blame them for anything. But man. If only I had someone at home. My therapist tuned out years ago, no one can listen to so much work crap, and frankly, therapy isn't very helpful when it's one of your 17 meetings that day. 

Lost all my friends from the previous life, most of my girlfriends were focused on building family, and we just didn't have anything in common anymore. And I didn't have time... 

If only there was someone there to tell me to slow down a little. To make better decisions. To think long-term. 

I ended up f\*cking up my career too, it's very hard to explain a burnout. No one wants a burnout. Can't get a lower level position either, it looks weird. I get interviews, but don't go through the first round. I'm not the best candidate. 

And guess what, as I started looking for a job again, I didn't even really have a network to reach out to. You'd think that while working at the largest companies on such huge teams I'd know a lot of people. And I do know a lot of people. But not really. The few that took my call just told me to ""why do you need a job, just go get married""! 

So anyway. Make sure to have a support system outside of work. If you make work your everything - you will have nothing left when it's gone.",user_7,429,45

And again. I went to Product but it’s very different and nobody cares about implementation, they just care about fancy ways to present impossible deadlines to IT. I don’t feel any hope about my “career” anymore. I love IT work but the perpetual boys club has cured me of my ambition and destroyed my mental health. I’m 40F and I don’t know what else to do with my life. Never thought I’d get to this point but I’ve given up trying. The people with power to change these things never care enough to change it. I sincerely hope they all choke on their inflated titles.

Bit of context, I’m a team lead/engineering manager for a mid sized application team. Yesterday I was having an off day in general and then had a few extra stressful things come up. 

Throughout the day I was stuck on calls with my direct reports/coworkers to fix the issue. I was joking, being silly and keeping a positive attitude. Around 3 or so I could hear my daughter and my husband getting into it (she’s 5 and in a new defiant stage that has been very challenging), to the point where my coworker could hear her screaming. This definitely got me a bit more overstimulated but I kept on. 

Earlier in the day I had been on a bigger call trying to figure out if there was an issue in production. Later (at the very end of the work day), I had a non-critical call with someone who was on the call earlier who proceeds to ask how it’s going when even from looking at me, you could probably tell my demeanor was off and I was busy multitasking trying to get things sorted. They continued to press and ask questions in an off hand way and it felt like they were poking an open wound. I was definitely more short than normal on this call, but was not rude.

I’m normally an incredibly happy, chipper, positive person even through stress. I happened to not be during this meeting. While I don’t think I was out of line, I didn’t feel great about my attitude and thought about apologizing to that person this morning.

If I had been a man, i wouldn’t have thought about my demeanor twice. I wouldn’t have batted a freaking eye that I wasn’t smiley and happy. And then to top it off, my boss had a call with me this morning to call me out. Not to ask if I was okay, because that’s not how I normally ask, but to call me out on my attitude. They said “if one of your direct reports acted like that you’d be wondering”.

They also said something about the way I acted in a slack thread. I reviewed it this morning and I was very light and positive, just needed to focus on what I was doing so declined (while saying “appreciated!”) some help because I just wanted to get said task done. Checked in with that direct report this morning and they didn’t have any qualms with how I handled anything.

The thing is, my direct reports do occasionally have bad days and negative attitudes. And if it’s out of the ordinary for someone I would ask how they’re doing and see what was going on, not call them out. “Hey I noticed you seemed off during the meeting yesterday, is everything okay? I know things were stressful but wanted to check in” is how I would have handled that. 

And what bothers me most is I made sure to turn my attitude back around last night/this morning so I could start fresh. I was noticeably better on the call with my manager right away. It just feels like I’m not allowed to be anything other than a happy robot. Beep borp, *insert agreeable tone at all times here*. And then I did reach out and apologize to the person on the call (after call with my manager) and they have yet to respond. Doesn’t feel great to swallow your pride over an off day and apologize for not being 100% chipper and then be ignored. But par for the course with them honestly lol.

TLDR: as a manager I felt called out for the one day my attitude wasn’t chipper and perfect during a stressful situation.",user_75,391,50

I’m grieving and so, so discouraged. ","When I started it was sort of a dream opportunity. Senior CSM for household name clients, working on a well-known product in the data space. Great work/life balance and a supportive and diverse team. I loved my boss and coworkers and was thriving. Glowing annual reviews. 

Cue the layoffs (just finished round four) and our leadership has been replaced by cutthroat frat boy/tech bro “sell-sell-sell” types. My counterparts (including my work bestie) have been let go, and I’ve inherited double the client work. 

I am chained to my desk with constant client requests and meetings where I’m needed as an SME. I’m burnt out, but if I take a day off, I return to a mountain of work. On the plane ride back from a client meeting, I burst into tears. I’m just so overworked and miserable.

Oh, and my new counterpart is an alcoholic misogynist. He shows up to client outings stoned and drunk, and makes inappropriate gendered comments, or overshares about his alcohol-related health condition. At a 4pm client meal I saw him have four double whiskeys. He made a comment about my body in front of the client. 

I reported this to his boss (I had no manager with the reorg), who called it “a grey area.” 

A coworker was later promoted to manager on my team, and she’s a nice person but she’s *very* junior, lacks technical knowledge, and has no management experience. I’ve tried to tell her I’m drowning, I’m hating this Drunk Bro dynamic. She gave me the “sorry you feel that way” bit and literally quoted her management training materials to me. I told her I needed a mental health day, and she said she wasn’t sure if that counts as a sick day. 

I’ve reported the Drunk Bro to HR, but of course they have to “get his side of the story,” and I’m just not optimistic given the attitude of our managers. I still have to work with this guy during the investigation and meanwhile I’m drowning in work.

I have always been a high achiever but I’m just feeling so discouraged and sad. I feel like I’m grieving the opportunity this used to be. I’m constantly stressing about work.

I’ve applied to over 100 jobs in the last few months, only a few interviews, no offers. I’m working my network like crazy, I’ve reworked my resume.

A few years ago I had my choice of multiple offers, but now it’s like crickets out there unless I want to take a huge pay cut. Still, I’m almost ready to rage quit. 

Not sure what I’m looking for in this post. I guess I just wanted to get it off my chest. ",user_28,379,28

I'm appreciative of the things it's afforded me like the ability to build a solid nest egg, move out of state, as well as great benefits and time off but I'm honestly fucking miserable at this point to where I've had at a mental/emotional breakdown at least once a quarter for the last year and a half. Aside from the mental gymnastics that comes with navigating corporate as a Black woman, masking is extra heavy bc of the toxic positivity I'm constantly surrounded by.

It feels like no matter how much I try, nothing I do is every good enough or right. My manager mentioned that I hit all of the goals we worked together to set for myself this past annual review -- yet I still got the same feedback as last year despite doing more work and being asked to manage two people without being paid extra or getting a title change. Most ideas I try to come up with are shot down or seen as unfeasible, and the direction I'm given ends up being wrong when I follow it. A recent example: My manager told me an email project ""wasn't urgent"", today I got questioned on why I ""wasn't moving faster"" on it three weeks ago when it was initially brought up. I'm not doing the work I set out to, been taken off projects I specifically asked to work on, and have no interest in my current job because the goalposts for growth are constantly moving. All I want to do is 100% of my job and go home, and I'm constantly being told that's not enough or being made to seem like not wanting to get promoted is a bad thing. Why would I continue to kill myself to have leadership see my value when I've tried and everyone EXCEPT me has gotten ""to the next level""?

Anyway, thanks for listening to my rant. For other WIT, how do you deal with wanting financial security but not wanting the emotional distress that comes with it? I sometimes wonder if leaving the news industry was a mistake -- at least it felt like I was doing something impactful. I've lost track of the ""why"" and am depressed.

- When I do something successfully, she takes credit for it, and when something is not very successful she has to draw out the criticism of it. Meanwhile, she is not producing anything.

This behavior and mindset is something that a lot of men in the engineering field have. I am a highly sensitive person and every mean comment, every insult I feel in my bones. When I stand up for myself and call someone out for their behavior, I am seen as hysterical and that they have to walk on egg shells to be around me. 

I have tried to befriend girls in my class, but they have already formed their groups and I don't feel that they really want me around.

It's been hard for me and I am really tired of being around men, I don't know what I should do and I feel like this is a viscous circle which will only make me more depressed.",user_94,305,57

We only get so many turns around the sun and I made it clear that I can’t be a part of hurting someone else like that. My integrity is not for sale.



I am a director in a fairly large tech org. Over the past few months, I’ve seen our corporate culture change from being very employee-centric to being very profit-centric. 

Businesses need to run, fine. However, with this shift, there have been layoffs throughout the company for the first time ever. That’s a bummer, but fairly straightforward. 

The weirder part is that we have been told to manage people out, even if they are high performers. 

I have had to fire a few people for poor performance and I’ve had to lay people off. Managing a good employee out seems toxic and I am struggling to find the balance between doing my job and retaining my morals. As someone who had been managed out, it is incredibly damaging to be gaslit into thinking that you are failing in your role. 

I need to reduce headcount by one person and I am so tempted to make it my own role. I feel so burnt out trying to lead a successful team and subsequently lying to them about their performance and their futures.

My two male business partners in a SaaS company we built for 8 years together screwed me out of my portion of profits when we finally got large clients. A whole year I worked on these 2 large clients, after years of chasing small deals. My portion was nearly $300k. And I never saw it. 

I got FIRED from a tech startup I joined right after, right before the 4th quarter, when I'd come into my bonuses and shares. Because I complained about an abusive manager who pulls me into the far corner of the office EVERY DAY and yells at me for an hour.

I later got screwed in a large consulting company, when they took me off my main client, gave a bonus from MY project to another guy who replaced me. That's right, he got the bonus from a finished project the day he got his new role. ""The company decided"". 

And then my FEMALE boss literally made me quit and took credit for all MY work, because I refused to cover up financial fraud.

I have been working as a software engineer for 8 years, and working at my current job for a little over 1 year. I am the only woman on my team, and multiple times per day, my teammate has been interrupting me, steamrolling conversations, explaining things to me that I already know, and explicitly telling me I don’t know what I’m talking about. When I make simple requests (like please communicate with me if you’re going to revoke my deployment permissions, as the most recent example) he will say something like “well I didn’t know you were going to take it personally”, implying that the problem is my emotions and not his actions. Every time I have talked to my manager about this, he says some version of “he’s just socially unaware”, “he’s a good person”, “he doesn’t mean anything by it”, etc. I’m sure you know the kind of response I’m getting if you are a woman in tech. 

My manager is focusing on the size of each micro-aggression, and not the quantity. I felt much more capable of brushing off the first 20,000 or so, but now I just feel so defeated every single time. It seems like everyone else on my team, including my manager, has some superhuman ability to just ignore all of it.

I know that this is just par for the course for women on male-dominated teams. I have dealt with this before (or worse), and I just can’t shake the feeling that I should be better at brushing it off by now and just accepting that this is part of the job. I know perfectly well that my manager/HR/whoever I escalate this to is not going to take any serious action. 

I was planning to leave this job, but then I got pregnant, and I’m trying to stick it out a few more months until my maternity leave. 

Do any of you ever get overwhelmed by just the sheer quantity of micro-aggressions? How do you deal with it when no one else seems to notice?

Interview 2 with a woman who is in various roles below the department head.

It's something that I reflect over, because on one end, I am supportive of creating an inclusive community of women that work in the technology industry, but on the other hand, it merges technical and non-technical roles in technology into one broad category and in doing so it seems like it minimizes the issues women face in technical roles.

I did my time in all of the lower level positions and worked hard to get where I am. My situation is that I have a younger male (late 20s) on my team, who speaks over me constantly. He literally repeats exactly what I said and everyone in the room behaves as though they are hearing it for the first time.  I've addressed it directly and asked him to stop. He slows down for a time but inevitably it picks back up. He's well spoken and a real showboat type, I've tried to use that to my advantage and give him opportunities that fit his level and allow him to shine.  None of this has stopped him from acting like he needs to fill my role. Now he is being invited to meetings that other people at his level are not invited to. I spoke to my boss about it and he told me I sound jealous and that I should be removing myself from these meetings and such anyways.  My counterparts in other Depts are not being told to stop participating. 

I have always struggled to feel like I belong in these environments as a woman and a person of color.  My insecurity is made worse because I come from a very poor and urban background.  I'm constantly paranoid that I don't sound professional enough so this behavior cuts right to my darkest fears.  And finally, I'm starting to fear that I am here to fill a quota. Maybe they just want me to shut up so they can say they have a woman of color in a senior position?  I'm struggling on how to handle this situation.

He refused to give me specific examples of how I’m not showing up to the team with “care and compassion” - I do not know how to take action on vague feedback. 

I asked repeatedly for specific examples, he said he could not share that with me for the sake of their privacy. He wouldn’t tell me ANYTHING. Except that multiple people came to him, apparently. 

For context, this manager is someone I’ve had a decent amount of conflict with. We’ve been in quite a few personal disagreements. Oddly, this is someone I nearly considered a friend at one point, so that’s adding to my confusion. When pressed for specific examples he only referenced these recent disagreements with him - which usually end in me apologizing because I really have/had no choice. He said he can’t give me specifics on the feedback but they track with his experience with me so he knows it must be accurate. This is completely unfair, right?! There’s a tiny part of me that thinks he’s lying about people coming to him to complain about me. I think this might be about me and him. 

One specific instance he brought up - again ffs - was early on when he became the manager of our team. I made an admittedly insensitive joke that was along the lines of “you sure switched teams fast” in a chat. That turned into a huge argument. Another time, he disliked my tone and delivery when I told him he didn’t need to attend a specific meeting I had scheduled, due to the objective of the call. Those are 2 great examples of our personal conflict. 

I’m emotional about this because I’ve been at my big tech company for years, I pride myself on the relationships I’ve built and I’ve always received stellar feedback. 

I’m known for my friendliness, ability to collaborate, and great attitude. A previous manager has referred to me as a “ray of sunshine” - my current situation has completely blindsided me. I’m still in shock. 

Any advice? I’m about to get on a 17 hour flight with him tomorrow (seated in different areas thankfully). The call today ended in me abruptly saying I have to go because I couldn’t think straight. I’m so overwhelmed and sad.

(Wanted to post this to general Tech career Reddit for awareness but couldn’t find one, nor my login for teamblind.com)

In both cases, they yelled at me out of frustration with others’ decisions who they couldn’t yell at. Thank god another colleague was there & witnessed - I’ll never take 1:1 meetings with these men. (Lesson from having a violent father - groupchats are your safety.) At the last job, one thoughtful male coworker witnessed and DM'd me asking if I was okay.

Both yellers showed hints of this aggression in group meetings with the Exec team. But in a smaller meeting of ICs, they really came for me.

Tomorrow we have a weekly with the Exec team. If he raises his voice again at me, I’m calling it out in front of them. This is literally how domestic violence starts, the come-home & kick the dog behavior of their wounded ego. Zero tolerance. HR should send them to therapy or anger management.

He responds “why, are you dipping out for your daily afternoon play date or something?” 

Honestly this is the last straw. I’m losing my patience with his behavior, not only is it untrue (he’s making these statements in front of directors and COOs above me) but it’s disrespectful and tbh a little crazy to me he would make these statements to his superior.

I am often picked for doing vague problems that are more system architecture related.

I am back to interviewing and I do pretty okay in these rounds ( a little rough). Had this pattern occur in 3 to 4 male engineers where they always say really rude things during interview.

1. Even upon my insistence don't believe I am hands on?
2. How am I not programming an ""x"" concept everyday?
3. Thinking that i want an easier route ? Of doing an oa vs a take-home
4. Being asked 4 questions to get to my actual ethnicity

One pattern I observe is most haven't worked in a capacity of leading an actual team & as I am dyslexic I have a very good read of if the individual is judging me (some don't really do a great job at hiding that condescending tone)

Am I allowed to believe that asian american male engineers tend to dislike asian females or asians in general ? 

This is not something I notice only in the interviews but also in the environment outside me here from asian americans. I don't want to think I am that bad at interviewing, but it's hard to say. Why are they judging me so fast?

Edit: I want to add that all the asians american men who were rude to me where exactly the same race as me & there is alot of prespective that my race is backward among the asian american community. I.e chinese Americans have a negative view of Chinese person ( but my accent and diction is very fluent ) I very rarely face that level of rudeness from fellow asians.

Edit : I did some searching, and it's something that is a thing that many fresh off the boat people experience from their American counterparts. It's often the fob vs. abc divide & you can google and read about it too. After my research, I found that the articles were so one-sided and from an ABC perspective, so take it how you may. I just find it interesting none of these conversations & podcasts are lead or driven by someone like me. ",user_111,239,74

","Context- this is UK where football refers to ""soccer"". In the UK, football is the most beloved sport in the country that almost all boys grow up playing with each other for fun, it's basically central to men's culture. 

At my organisation, the big end of year social event organised by (male) management is a football game (as in we play football together). This is a male-dominated organisation and the social event is the only one happening. The social events at an organisation are great places to network and bond with coworkers and management, however most women have pretty much no experience playing football and wouldn't be able to play with mostly male teams anyway. So this sidelines mainly the women at the organisation. 

The men I've spoken to about this mainly say it doesn't really matter and we can still turn up and be the audience?? Lol. The only guy that privately agreed with me is someone who is not into sports at all and wouldn't play. 

What do you think about this? Do you have experience with these types of events? I feel it is subtly exclusionary of the women at the company. ",user_113,229,132

Lots of this stuff I haven’t ever done.

But today was the last day of the Academy AND I WAS #1 ON THE LEADERBOARD! I DID IT! 🥹

Lots of people were disqualified for missing days. By the end, I was the last woman still in.

I stand up for myself and politely push back on things I don’t feel are right. If I feel I’m being disrespected, I call it out. I accept valid and substantiated criticism but I don’t accept character assassination.

However, I’m constantly labeled as “aggressive” and that is seen as a problem to be managed-out.

When men do the exact same thing as me, they don’t get the “aggressive” label. They’re not given any label at all, really. It seems it’s expected for men to speak up without fear of retribution. 

I even have an example in my most recent job where both me and a male colleague challenged something in the exact same way. I was hauled aside and told I needed to “get on board or else.” He was given a very public debate in which our manager conceded that he had a valid point. Afterwards, my colleague said to me that he didn’t understand why I wasn’t treated the same as him.

I luckily can commiserate with female friends who have all experienced the same as me, so I know it’s not a “me” problem. I’m about to enter into a new chapter of starting a family, and I will need to be more assertive than ever with setting and enforcing boundaries. I can’t afford to not work, so I will have to face into this worrying trend. I’m terrified I will end up at best being unable to enforce a balance and never seeing my children, or at worst constantly unemployed and searching for work while trying to raise a family.

Situation 1:
Manager forgot to invite me to a team end of year appreciation meeting at the end of last year.   
Walked by my desk, told me that he was sorry (it didn't appear super genuine tbh) and then he said it was unintentional and he was wondering why I wasn't at the meeting.   He had already seen me previously earlier in the day, so he knew I was there.    Not sure why he wouldn't wait to have the meeting if he knew I was there and wasn't joining it.  


Situation 2:
Fast forward to today.   I was again excluded on an important email to stakeholders about the status about a system that I am directly involved in that is no longer broken.  

Benefit of the doubt is that he 'fat fingered it' as my other male coworker suggested.  

Notably, he included my other male coworker (""B"") who had the same experience level as me.  

If I am actively involved on the project, why am I not a part of the official communications?


Situation 3:
Well, about two months ago, my coworker ""B"" who is retiring in a few days, decided that I should ""focus on what I am best at"" which is software.  

My coworker ""A"" is a Chinese guy my same age and approximately same experience level, only difference is, he majored in electrical engineering.    He is also not neurodivergent (I am), and he is male so he blends in.   

So the guy who is retiring 2 months ago (coworker B) after deciding I should 'only' do software, has decided this week to spend some time training the other Chinese coworker (coworker B) to resolve hardware issues for the purpose of his continued learning, after coworker B retires.   

Coworker B, the retiring guy, told me when I was trying to resolve issues and fix tickets and put in max effort, that I should let coworker B handle this because he has the credentials to do so and the 'electrical engineering background'

Naturally, I feel frustrated, and disheartened about this.   I feel like it's a level of discrimination in a way, that because I'm 'just' a lady in software engineering, that everyone assumes I either 'can't do' or 'don't want to do' hardware.  

I felt like coworker B was totally unaware of my qualifications, and was unwilling to train me because of his own biases.  Two days ago, coworker B had a long conversation with me trying to tell me unconscious bias does not exist. 


So.  How would you handle a pattern of exclusion?

Additional context:
I'm the only lady on my team and one of the only software engineers.   I'm autistic (and neurodivergent) so I'm often not able to pick up on subtleties.   However, this pattern is overt enough I am identifying it.  


How would you proceed?
How can I change this pattern of being excluded?


Edit:

Sorry if it was misunderstood, my goal here is to assume positive intent behind all this. 


Second edit:

I got a lot of new understanding about all this.   Turns out, my understanding was totally incorrect.  (I was wrong) 

Coworker ""A"" actually has a PHD; not just a bachelors, and it seems I wasn't aware of that.  

Now I get it, and that makes a lot more sense.   So situation 3 isn't personal, turns out Coworker A actually does have more qualifications than all of us, and that's why he was trained and I wasn't.    

So glad I got this straightened out, and I'm sorry if this post was confusing for y'all.  ",user_70,222,153

Hi all, thought I would give an update to my previous posts asking for advice when my VP of engineering invited all the female engineers in my building to lunch together. I wanted to profusely thank everyone here because I truly could not have performed(?) better in that meeting if I wanted to, and it’s all because of the recommendations I got here.  

TL;DR VP wanted to help us form a women’s group. Our parent company’s lawsuit about equal pay was not mentioned. Given the fact that a VP has now verbally committed to helping with the legal and budget stuff to form the group I am somewhat hopeful it could happen.  

Edit: I don’t plan on getting involved with starting this society up because I don’t work for free 😇 he didn’t call on me asking me to do something like he did other people so I’m taking that as a sign that I’m clear  

First of all, the meeting was pretty straightforward. There was catered lunch and about a dozen women in the room, most of whom I hadn’t met before. The VP came after a few minutes (along with a female senior manager who I hadn’t met before) and he started talking to us about some of the issues we have in the office. Basically it was clear he was pushing for us to form some sort of women’s org, it seemed like he genuinely just wanted to make an improvement for us because he was trying to problem solve and see how we could make it happen. Not just vague “oh yea you should do that, go ahead” comments if that makes sense.  

I was pretty blunt in my feedback and said that the company has x and y policies that would prevent that from happening, and he said he would work to get us an exception and also some funding. At this point other people started brainstorming and my spidey senses started tingling, I decided to shut up in case he picks someone to be in charge of the new group. Sure enough a few minutes later he calls on the poor girl who just started a few months ago and asks her to do it, and I was glad to not have extra unpaid work on my plate.  

He asked about any further feedback and I gave him a technical suggestion but everyone kinda just was silent so I took that to mean that the discussion should just be around women’s issues 😅  

One thing that frustrated me a little was that he suggested we do lunch meetups and I told him that due to time zone differences with colleagues in different offices, 12 to 2 is often our most busy time of day and nearly everyone has a meeting during that time. He basically said “just move the meeting for a day or tell the others that you have another event” and I told him (maybe this was too forward but I tried to keep my tone neutral) that I anticipated female engineers who are the only women on their team, especially more junior engineers, might feel uncomfortable with that.  

I explained that sometimes it’s easy to project your own concerns onto others even if they have not shown any bias or mistreatment, and many women would fear judgment or perceived lack of dedication to work etc if we were to go out of our way to skip team meetings for the a women’s org meeting. I don’t think he could really get what I was saying so I just dropped it and hoped that the female senior manager understood and would try to explain it to him later.  

I chatted with him a bit afterwards at a happy hour event and invited him to lunch with my team next week! He seems like a pretty reasonable guy actually interested in making changes, I know for a fact my concerns are not being escalated to the higher ups by my manager so maybe it’s time to (after memorizing a carefully crafted diplomatic phrasing) take things into my own hands.",user_122,202,52

Tech industry attracted the most evil horrible people because of how much money USED to be in it. But somehow the general image has been that only smart nerdy introverts get into tech. That isn't true. 

I want to share the story of how I lost $300k, but that was ok, because I also almost lost my life. 

Moved to NYC from Eastern Europe at 21, was hoping to build a career in advertising, but ended up waiting tables. As you do lol. As I'm trying to come up with something more sustainable, I'm trying to come up with some sort of business for myself, I'm good at advertising, I'm good at sales, there has to be something I can do with that and with my connections back home. Until I find something! 

This relative of mine reaches out, the one who lend me money to move to the US to begin with, and tells me him and his friend (both developers) just finished this product - it's an HR system, a rip off of SuccessFactors, but made on SharePoint. Same functionality for fraction of the cost. See, they both have just been fired from their job maintaining SuccessFactors at a large company, they didn't want to work for someone else anymore, so they locked themselves in the basement for 6 months, and finished the product, fueled by pizza and coffee. And check this out. They made a website, people are reaching out, they already have a few HUNDRED ""contact us"" requests, but because they're both nerdy nerds who don't know how to talk to humans they need someone to talk to humans for them. Oh, and all the requests are from the US. 

The year is 2010.

So I join. Since I need to pay my bills here and would need to quit my job for this, we agree on a salary of $4k/month (what I was making waiting tables) +30% of the sales as a commission. So we technically split profits 3 ways, but I kinda get a little more money than them, because of this ""salary"", but we all agree that I can't do this only based on commissions, since it is a full time job, and I do live in you know, the most expensive city in the world. This will become important later. 

I start reaching out to the people who filled out the ""contact us"" form, start showing them the product and what do you know! People start buying the system! The first client is $5k. The second is $27k. And we keep going. 1-2 clients per month, $30k-80k per month in sales. I'm starting to feel good. 

We register an LLC here in the states, but they refuse to put my name on it. I'm a young girl, a sucker, I don't insist, and I let it go. We open a bank account, everything is registered to my home address, checks come to my home. 

Things are going ok, I make around $80/year, I'm 24. They start hiring people back in Europe, more developers, product is growing, support packages are growing, it's a legit business. 

I come to visit my hometown one day, come to the office - and no one really knows who I am. So these guys make it seem like they're the ones handling sales this whole time, while in reality none of them spoke to any clients, like, ever. I let it go, it's ok. I'm just so grateful to have a job. 

I do get a little bitter, that while they all seem to have an office here, team, team outings, they're all friends with each other, I'm in Brooklyn all alone, working crazy hours from home. But I say, it's ok. It's fine. I go back.

These 2 partners of mine start coming to the US a lot, we go to conferences, they pay for very expensive hotels for us, luxurious dinners, and they even talk about moving their families to the US. We go to California a few times and even look at office spaces in Bay Area. 

They treat me like shit the whole time. 

But I keep working, no one else is really hiring me in the US (I do apply for jobs every now and then), so I decide to work a little harder on this business to make some more money. See, those $80k we all make allow for a VERY LUXURIOUS lifestyle in Eastern Europe, but in Brooklyn I sometimes treat myself to an expensive cheese lol. So I want more money. I'm thinking this will be good for everyone. 

I get 2 very large clients, I spend a whole year on just those two. We have a few smaller clients, but business has slowed down with smaller clients, there was now a lot of other HR tools, like Bamboo who were even cheaper and easier to use. 

So ok. I get 2 large clients. Total of almost $1M for both in the same year. And then things get weird. 

So we have 2 bank accounts - one in the US, one in Europe. I pay my income taxes, but don't get involved in corporate taxes, since you know, my name isn't on anything anyway. My partners insist these 2 clients pay to the European account. And then they start ignoring me. They stop answering my calls, everyone in the company now ignores me, and I have no idea what the hell is going on. 

After very weird 6 months, where I don't even receive the leads from the website anymore and start suspecting they hired someone else to do sales now, they eventually come to the US again for a conference. They're acting weirder than ever, and I'm just so oblivious about what the hell is going on, I can't wrap my mind around it. 

I keep pretending everything is ok, as I keep asking questions. Are we cool? Did the client pay? And if so, where is my portion? Are we still working together? Did I do something wrong? 

I keep pressing and they finally give me a story. Idk what to make of it, I'll just tell you what it is. They say they wanted to avoid paying taxes, so they open an offshore account somewhere though a 3rd party. And they were ""going to send me my money"" once those accounts settle and money is in. But that third party company just got arrested, because turned out they also opened accounts for people who trade illegal weapons, so now ALL accounts opened by that 3rd party all are arrested. So the money is frozen and there is ""nothing they can do right now"".

They leave the US. As I notice that back home they each bough a $250k new apartments with luxurious renovations, and both of them and their wives now all drive $80k cars. While the money is ""frozen"". 

I technically still work there, they send me my salary, but I no longer get any leads that come from the website. And I don't know if it's because there aren't any, or they're going to someone else. 

I can't find another job, no one would even give me an interview and I'm getting desperate. 

They come to the US again. They loved coming to the US for bullshit conferences, it was their break from families, and I was the one who'd organize everything. Like a freaking travel concierge. Conference, hotels, dinners, shopping, activities. As I realize I have been scared of them for a very long time now. I can't 'not go"" to the conference, they say they'll ""fire me"". I'm scared. I can't even explain the weird horror state I'm in. Confused. Tired. and Scared.

So I go. I decide to ""sort this out"" once and for all. We're drinking in their hotel room in Las Vegas. As we'd often do. I keep asking. They get angrier and angrier. 

Until they finally snap. And say ""you're not getting your money. Instead, if you ask again, we're going to kill you"". 

And the I don't remember the next 6 months. Literally the next thing I remember is sitting on my couch 6 months later, I'm 30 lbs heavier, my hair is in a pixie cut, I don't know how to read, I can barely walk, something is wrong with my body and my brain is a jello. As the super is knocking at my door because I'm getting evicted since I haven't been paying my rent. 

I had $2k in my bank account, I rented a room in Harlem, and got a job waiting tables again. I was 26.

I'm ok, I managed to build a new career after that (in tech consulting), that I have quit since, I've been travelling for 3 years now all over the world as a journalist, I'm a writer, I just got into PR, and I'm alive, but hell. Do I still think about that....

Never in my life did I think that I would come to absolutely hate the job that I worked my ass off to get.

To be honest, it isn’t the job itself. It’s the severe lack of support and micro-aggressions (I don’t even know if they can be called that) that I have to constantly deal with.

I brought five years of professional experience with me when I joined this role. It was still a junior level role, to be clear. I did not fake my way into a level that I was under-qualified for.

There were several red flags from the get go. But I chose to ignore them because I was desperate to find a job after graduating from grad school during peak 2023 layoff season. 

Two months into this role, my manager implied in a team meeting that the reason why the extended team was being friendly to me at a team event was because I looked very pretty. My team didn’t understand what he was saying because he implied this by referring to a conversation that him and I had had a few days prior. 

Six months in, a colleague X complained to my manager that I wasn’t contributing at the same level that one of my teammates (Y) was. Y is 2 levels my senior and has been doing this job for 6+ years at this company, and for over 20 years overall. Instead of correcting expectations, my manager decided to schedule a 1-1 with me, and then proceeded to tell me that he (and the rest of my team) thought that I was unfit for this job.

For the record - I’ve consistently exceeded all expectations for my role/level. And none of this feedback was provided in writing, just verbally.

Eight months in, I worked my ass off on a project and helped deliver a presentation that turned a hesitant customer into one that wanted to sign a $500,000 deal with us over the course of a 60-minute meeting. The moment they gave us written confirmation, I found myself no longer being invited to any of the closing calls that cemented the whole thing in place. Y took over everything. I repeatedly asked to be added to calls, and they would conveniently forget each time. I told my manager that this was frustrating, and his response was to tell me that I am assuming malice, and that they probably just forgot. 

I have been at this role for about one year. Every time something looked hopeless or not worth my teammates’ time, I got to own the whole thing. I was able to nurture few hopeless opportunities into something tangible that would greatly benefit our team’s goals. The moment something became promising, I stopped getting included.

Every single time I have met my manager, the feedback I get is that I need to go above and beyond what I’m already doing. What I do is never enough. When I ask him *what* I should be doing, he says that I should constantly seek opportunities to contribute to the team “above and beyond” what I was already doing. It’s vague. There is no clear action.

I told him once that I would love to help organise customer-facing marketing events. Some of my teammates do this, and I told my manager that I would love to be looped in. Organising these events is not part of my core responsibilities. So this should count as “above and beyond”, right? My manager agreed, and he said that he will let me know the next time an opportunity arises. Fantastic!

Two weeks later during our 1-1, my manager goes, “Hey, you wanted to organise events right? Can you organise a baby shower for Q (only other female teammate who was leaving on maternity leave)?”

When a male teammate had expressed a similar interest in marketing events a month or so before I did, he got plugged in to 2 separate events immediately. He did not have prior experience organising professional events. I do. And this is the response I get.

Over the past few weeks, I have pretty much started to feel a sense of dread when I think about work 
and annual performance reviews that will soon come up. I am terrified that I will be poorly rated despite having done my absolute best. Despite me meeting all the expectations for my level.

And the worst part, and probably the reason why I am so stressed out, is because my immigration status in the US is completely dependent on this stupid fucking job, and I cannot afford to quit it. For the first time ever, my life is completely bound to my job and it is a source of constant anxiety and despair. I started from scratch in this country and I cannot go back to my home country as there is no safety net for me there.

If it breaks the sub rules please delete the post.

I have been working in the Pharma industry for the last +10 years (QA), and although money is absurdly good, I am finding myself more and more miserable with every passing year. I have changed positions/companies in average every 2 years, but the full blunt of how disgusting the industry is has just started hitting me the more “senior” positions I have.

I took a break just recently after leaving a very toxic environment… the highlight was always being called “pedantic” by other coworkers at the same level.

I joined another company a couple of months ago after my break and everything is a disaster. The employee turnover is insane, the area I am in is severely understaffed and I have caught them in bad practices. Of course being the path of resistance has already put a huge target on my back and I can feel being left out of emails and discussions regarding what I am doing.

At this point I am miserable, I am making my husband miserable, and I honestly cant seem to find a job because all this negativity is probably reflecting poorly in my applications. I am too overqualified for certain positions and too underqualified for others. I was trying to stick in this company because of the maternity leave (I am not US based) but that also hasn’t happened and it doesn’t look like it will.

I am tired of my attitude, I am tired of dealing with jerks and malpractices… I will probably end up leaving the industry with no idea or skills for anything else.

It just feels so disrespectful, like I'm not worth the effort trying to actually teach. He does this a lot. Sometimes he just doesn't respond. He'll leave me out of meetings too.

Our work is primarily men and our group is 4 men and 2 women. I’ve noticed that one of the guys always changes the subject when we talk about topics that are more for women. And while it is normal to have multiple conversations going in a group of 6, he will always turn to the guys in the group and be like “Sooooo -guy’s name-, how was your week” very loudly. It feels like he is purposefully signaling that he is not interested. And this has happened multiple times for various topics, some were more heavy such as how women are treated in male dominated industries and some are lighter such as thoughts on the bachelor or Taylor swift (so it’s not like this only happens when talking about “controversial” topics). Also we listen to them talk about more “men’s topics” such as video games and sports we are not interested in but do not make them feel bad about that

Anyway, last time it happened I called him out and was like ‘why do you do that every time we talk about topics that are more interesting for women? It just seems a little rude because it makes me feel like what I am talking about is stupid to you’. I just called him out and the group moved on so no big fight or anything, but now I am having the post confrontation second hand anxiety about if I should have talked to him individually or gentler 

Edit: thank you all for being so supportive, it sounds like we have all done something like this or wish we had done something like this

Second edit: for people wondering about why I described some topics as womens vs men’s, that was just to give context because I can’t describe every single instance this has happened. I know women can like sports and video games",user_131,189,61

I was reporting directly to C-Suite in quite a big tech company. I liked it but all the company itself didn't do well in the end, so they laid off a significant amount of staff.

I now have a job offer - tech start-up, only 30 people. My gut feeling told me 'no' the very first time I spoke to my potential new manager. Male, in his 40s. I noticed immediately that he talked over the very young and pretty HR assistant, whereas later in the 2nd interview with the Head of HR he forced himself to be more professional. I could tell the difference. He was a little cowardice, and manipulative.

I am torn and my stomach is upside down when I think about starting this job in just two weeks. I have no yet made any arrangements; I would have to move continents for this job. I have no other offers at the moment though, interviews with other companies (that I would prefer) are dragging out or I am being ghosted entirely.

A big part of me is screaming 'no' to this job - I am nearly 50 and remember the times when I was in my 20s when I had to deal with very chauvinistic male managers and I had forgotten about it ...until now.

Another part of me feels silly to decline that job. Should I be more mature and just deal with it? I am grown up, I should be able to handle flirty chauvinists right?  Also, I am getting scared, my unemployment is running out soon.

I don't know what to do - is it stupid to reject an offer because my new manager is already very flirty and getting personal?

It was weird from the first minute on and it didn't get better in the process. My first thought was - ''cool company cool idea, but no way am I working for this guy''. I was about to cancel, but then they offered the job right away at the end of the 2nd interview which caught me off guard. (also...is this a little unprofessional?). They only told me the salary in the contract and then pushed me to sign it. Also...unprofessional? This all happened within 36 hours. They know I d have to move continents for this job.

So, I asked if I could start 1 week later - ONE WEEK - because I would be moving and sitting 12 hours in an airplane. I would need to open a bank account, find an apartment etc etc. I was very polite about that in an email. My new manager wanted to call me immediately ( I hate that disrespect towards other people's time and also it would have been 4 am my time). I didn't pick up and asked if we could meet later. He knows which time zone I am in.  Later that day, we talked and I felt he was guilt-tripping me, he started the conversation with a whiny accusative voice asking personal stuff saying things like -  'whats going on in your life' and asking if I had any personal problems and if anything bad happened - cause...why would I ask for a later start date. How dare I. He told me that he has so much work to do himself, and wants me to start as soon as possible, and ...poor him, he is so overworked. ..Red flag? He asked me 'not to overthink it,...to just start' and 'he would never fire me'. Ewww, this makes me feel sick. I am not looking for a boyfriend or a therapist. I am looking for a job.

I don't know, all of these statements sound very fishy to me. I worked so hard to be independent in my career and deal with professional stakeholders. Taking this job feels like decades of going back to being mistreated by male managers who get a little too flirty and a little too personal. I feel like I am signing up to work for a pub, not a tech company. On the other hand - the actual product of the company is great. Also, their CEO seems to be a very elegant person - reading articles about him online. But unfortunately, I would not work for him but for the 'pub bro' manager.

What do I do? While I am trying this my gut says' don't do it'. I feel so childish. Shouldn't I be more grown up to handle this? Especially since I am unemployed?",user_49,188,150

Gave a career talk and this high school girl was rolling her eyes throughout ,"I gave a ""career"" talk to  high school aged girls in a stem summer program, and this one girl was  shaking her head and rolling her eyes  very animatedly at multiple points throughout. It's a very high level ""this was my journey to where I am now, and here are the challenges I had throughout / things I learned along the way."" Mostly that it's ok to take time to figure out / explore what you want to do, that unexpected stuff will get in the way of your plans but may lead you to new paths you wouldn't have encountered otherwise and can come to cherish, and that a lot of science careers are built on incremental progress over a long period of time (you don't need to stress about big academic wins -- prestigious papers / awards / schools -- the way we are sometimes pressured to in academia).

I have mixed feelings about it -- on the one hand, teenagers are going to be bratty and tbh maybe being able to be so rude about a woman sharing their journey in stem / giving advice for younger women indicates it's now super mundane (which is a good thing / indicates we've got a lot more women in STEM). I also have no idea what specifically she was reacting too; for all I know it wasn't even my talk and she was just thinking about other things.

In terms of momentum to keep doing outreach like this, lots of folks have reached out when I've given different versions of the talk to say they really appreciated it and learned a lot from it, so it's not too discouraging to have this one reaction. I was taken aback, because I could never imagine being so rude to a total stranger talking time out of their day for outreach. 

I also wasn't as smooth today with the talk as I have been in the past so for a moment I was like ""oh am I doing that badly?"" inside. Imposter syndrome runs deep lol.

Anyone else have stories like this / advice on how they got over negative reactions from kids / younger folks when trying to do outreach? 

[UPDATE:

Thanks all for the thoughtful replies and sharing your experiences! It's helpful, and I think I was just caught off guard and will expect this in the future/ be better mentally prepared for it in the moment. 🙂

Main take-aways for me:

- Teenagers are just like this, plus you won't resonate with everyone (for a whole host of reasons). Focus on the ones that are connecting with you.

- In a setting where it makes sense (it didn't here), directness might be useful and lead to insights (e.g. ""you seem to be having a strong reaction to what I just said, what are your thoughts on this?""). It could lead to a good conversation or at least help the person know their reactions are seen.

- It's impossible to know what it was about without asking: it's always possible parents put here there / she didn't want to be there / I sounded too much like other adults she didn't want to listen too / my description of things sounded too fluffy/ privileged. Related, someone asked if this was in a privileged area (where maybe it's even more likely she was told to be there) -- it definitely is; I think the program tries to draw from a broader crowd, but in reality I don't know how economically diverse it is.

Whew! Thank you all so so much for sharing your experiences, thoughts, feedback, and concerns! Overwhelmed with all of this and I have a lot of thinking to do. I do plan on providing an update in about 6-8 months on where I land. Really appreciate everyone's comments! Apologies for not responding to all. 

  
------------------

Hi all,

I've been in tech for the past 13 years. I'm a highly paid individual and my spouse is currently in the midst of interviews now after being funemployed to explore other options (I was fully supportive) and they want to get back into the field. I kind of feel like it's my turn as I'm mentally done with tech. (the words *quarterly OKRs* is now a trigger lol)

However, I'm grappling with possibly leaving tech altogether and it's a lot of money being left on the table.

We're both adept with managing our finances and live below our means so I'm not concerned about that, and my spouse is fully supportive, as they are also a staff level. I was raised in poverty so the idea that I'm walking away from loads of money/security seems silly. However, I'm due with our first child in 3 months and I'm thinking about the generational wealth that I'm leaving behind + opportunities but I also want to spend time with my child.

I've always been a creative person and I want my next role to be that but the pay decrease is insane. Has anyone left tech and gone into something more creative? i.e baking, writing a book, design, etc.

Would love to hear some of your experiences! Thank you in advance.",user_138,177,97

As most of us in this sub do, I work primarily with men. We have a few dozen managers at my level overseeing our various product groups - I am one of four women currently in the role and only the 6th woman to be in this role in my company's history. I am also the youngest manager (30yo) and the first one to be pregnant on the job.

I am almost through my first trimester in my very first pregnancy and I was nervous to share the news. I think women in male-dominated fields often feel pressure to represent our whole sex and can worry that our actions will paint all women a certain way. My worst thoughts were along the lines of, ""They won't want to hire women anymore because we just end up getting pregnant and leaving for a while,"" ""They'll think I'm not committed to my job,"" ""They'll think I'm incapable of handling it all."" Maybe a little dramatic in hindsight, but I think I had legit reasons. My younger sister worked at the same company in a separate department for a while, and her direct manager made comments like, ""You should get married as young as you can, it just gets harder as you age,"" and ""You'll probably have to choose between your family and your career at some point after you get married."" She left the company after HR failed to do anything about it.

Well, I told a few folks at work this week and every single interaction went amazingly well. First off, my boss was immediately excited for me and said as a people leader it is vital to model the behaviors you want to encourage in your team (in this case, taking whatever leave is needed). He assured me that we'd find someone to cover my role for however long I decided I wanted to be out and offered to take responsibilities off my plate if I felt I needed it later on in the pregnancy. 

Then I told my account manager who is pretty tough and usually a no-nonsense kind of guy. He also lit up immediately, congratulated me, and went so far as to offer up his and his wife's old baby stuff. Another (male) manager said we'd have to throw a baby shower at work! I was so nervous about my news being an inconvenience to these folks, but everyone so far has been so supportive and genuinely happy for me. Just wanted to share that there are good companies out there, even if they have bad apples like my sister's old manager.

I’m (Enterprise CSM) feeling dismayed about the expectations placed on women leaders at my workplace (public SaaS company starting a new Enterprise department). The expectations placed on them under C-Suite male leadership are high. The pattern is like… after something is “fixed” or a process is developed, these women leaders are shifted back into their original space (eg leading a new Product team and then stepping back into their prior PM role). 

Does anyone else resonate? Is this a thing? Part of me is excited by these women getting the opportunity to expand their skills… but I’m also wary that these leaders seem to only be tapped tapped when we are in a dire / urgent moment. 

Synopsis here:
“The term “glass cliff” is a phenomenon in which a company in crisis appoints a woman to turn things around — often setting them up for failure. Some saw Boeing naming Stephanie Pope to run its commercial airplanes division in March as the latest example. Companies say they aren’t consciously doing this. But some researchers think companies in crisis sometimes turn to women because they are perceived as having the soft skills needed to navigate difficult situations. The glass cliff is also prevalent in other countries and outside the corporate world: in government, sports leagues and at universities.”",user_141,174,13

I am more likely to regard myself as disabled due to many barriers from the identities of how people perceive me.

I certainly have many characteristics of autistic people and people often seem to see me as subordinate quite automatically but my perception is that their automatic reception of such information about me is quite tangible and makes me quite revolting. The worst case was that a woman always talked to me very nicely and calmly but it was her manipulative tactic to conceal her agenda. I met quite many narcissists and narcissistic people and now I feel like I am quite well educated to detect who is a narc. 

However, seriously, does everybody really get a job just because they can fake things so well?
I don’t know, the video clip makes me wonder where I can find my career and real professionals. I see many unqualified professionals with overinflated egos and they often insidiously try to undermine my self-esteem. It is disheartening but they were not just men but women, too. 
I am not based in the US but the video clip can be relatable to anyone who works at corporations and if the corporation is not one of the top tech giants, I am sure it would more likely get hired by some other merits that are not always tied to expertise.

Is anyone talking about this?,"Has there been any studies or discussion about how the current tech job market has affected women in particular? 

Here's why I am asking: I know that for many of us, job hopping has been one of the only tools we have for dealing with toxic managers, sexism, being underpaid, or a lack of career opportunities. Quite often when people talk about bad work situations in this sub, the top answers are something like ""This is unlikely to change, so it's time to leave your job.""

However, I also keep hearing about how brutal the job market is after all the layoffs and talk about AI. From my personal experience, I have been in a pretty terrible job situation for the past year and a half, but I haven't focused on finding a new job because I'm no longer getting responses when I apply to new jobs or reach out to recruiters. (I'm also taking maternity leave soon and have some timing issues around that.) 

Staying in a bad situation hasn't been without consequences. Even though I am still getting paid and I'm trying as hard as I can to disconnect from it emotionally, I'm struggling more and more every day to feel optimistic about my own prospects and ability to survive in this industry in the future. Staying in a bad job has made it more appealing to give up and leave the industry altogether.

What do you think? Do you think women have been disproportionately affected by the lack of job opportunities? Are you feeling stuck in a job that is bad for you just because it's too hard to leave? ",user_9,175,69

I guess that gives me almost a week to stress over this unnecessarily!!!  

Like the title says: today our VP of engineering sent out an invite to literally every single female engineer or engineering manager in my building (about a dozen of us total) for a catered lunch on Friday. I think he picked my building specifically (we are in a large campus of several buildings) because almost everyone in it is in sales with few engineers, so even if he invites all the female engineers it’s still a relatively intimate group. I think he might have scheduled it for a few reasons:  

1. Election outcome: given the timing I guess it’s possible he wants to be an ally to female employees but I’ve never heard of an exec here scheduling meetings about anything other than the actual work so I don’t think this is the case  
2. Another company under our parent company has had accusations recently of gender-based discrimination. I honestly don’t know much about it however I do know it included some engineers there so maybe he wants to talk to some female employees here and get a sense for how we are treated  

Has anyone else had a meeting like this, and if so how did it go?  

Edit we are a tech startup that was bought a few years ago (before I joined) by a large healthcare company, the person in question is VP of engineering for just my company not the healthcare company as a whole. My company has a couple thousand employees, the parent company has maybe 100k total over all the subsidiaries? We are in Minnesota which is a one party consent state but I don’t know if our contracts have anything in them that says we can’t record at work, it’s been a while since I’ve seen mine.  

Edit 2 After asking around it appears that he’s genuinely trying to get to know female engineers better for diversity&inclusion, he scheduled a previous session like this in another building which I hadn’t heard of before this.

But unfortunately that is not the case all the time. My mood plummets for at least two to three days and I just can’t bring myself to work. I have always assumed that these were burning out signs but honestly they weren’t in some cases. I was doing just fine the day before but for some reason I find things unclear and have no motivation the next day. 

Is this pmsing? I hate it when such things affect my work isn’t there a way out of such hormonal anxiety or depressions? 


Edit:
Thank you everyone for your inputs. It will be helpful going forward after hearing your perspectives

There are few takeaways I’ll be listing here as a summary from your comments
1. One thing is clear that I’m not alone in this. There are folks who have had similar problems for years. They were successful in their careers and that gives me lot of hope and relief

2. It was a great advice to inspect external factors before introspecting. It’s true that my work isn’t the best, I do get unrealistic timelines but I had made peace with it knowing the market is terrible and they try to compensate by unlimited offs. I find it harder when that unrealistic timelines expectation falls when I’m already low and not my best self, which is basically now. Though my current work is not ideal I’ll have to stick to it for quite sometime. 

3. Another great advice was to just letting it go. I realize that I can’t control every aspect of my work life, although that’ll be great. Accepting how my mind works and cutting myself some slack during these low days would be doing myself a huge favor. 

4. I became aware recently that being hyper productive and then being the exact opposite is an ADHD symptom. Even though I’d like to tackle it by myself by being more disciplined. I read somewhere that “sometimes we choose the tougher path because we feel the need to punish ourselves in order to achieve great things ? But what's wrong in choosing the easier path especially when we are not prepared for the tougher one ?” I might consider a screener few months down the lane when I feel I’m ready. It’s best get myself diagnosed. That might help me tackle these problems a bit better.

If neither of those things interest you...good to know.

>Pat: That “major medical event” as been going on since time immemorial. Don’t be so snide- (“if neither of those things interest you...”) I’ve raised (my wife and l) 2 children of my own,. See my response to Greg Lloyd in this stream.

>Commentor: why did your daughter need a law degree if her purpose in life is to raise children?

>Pat: Shes able to do both. If she wants.

>Commentor: Well, in this day & age, I am guessing there are a whole bunch of men making a note of your comment & company, so that they don’t apply there. I have 4 great nephews, and their dads, 2 nephews, 1 nephew-in-law, are super involved dads. One is a lawyer, another is a math degree analyst at Greenshield, and the 3rd works in tool&die. Trust me, young male lawyers are paying attention to benefits these days. 
Just as much as women. 
Gone are the days of treating associates like crap. 
Time to wake up, buddy. Or retire.

>Pat: Back in the day some women working in the fields had their baby, put it down, and were able to continue working. This is true. Now, the husband needs 26 weeks off ?? What an absolute joke. We’ve becone a nation of weaklings and that’s why we’re in the place we’re at. Imagine if Mickey Mantle took 26 weeks off every time one of his 4 sons were born. Further, Imagine if George Washington had kids, and took off 26 weeks every time one was born. We’d still be speaking with a British accent. Go ahead- take your 26 weeks off!
Or Thomas Edispn took 26 weeks off every time a kid was born. We’s still be reading by candelight. Great things, in my opinion, are not accomplished by men who need to take 26 weeks off when their kid is born. Opinions may differ.

>Commentor: 100% agree Pat. If my employees are more interested in a healthy relationship with their family than generating more wealth for my business and shareholders, are they really even men..? 
Also, people, just because we have developed technology so sophisticated that our ancestors who built this country would assume it is some kind dark magic, that’s no reason men (not me, of course, but my employees) shouldn’t still grind themselves into an early grave.
The machine needs souls, people! Give it your men and let the women raise their replacements!
All hail the machine!!

> Pat:  Oh please go back into your office to reading your high school copy of the Communist Manifesto. You get nowhere in life without PAYING THE PRICE. 26 weeks is ridiculous.

——-

>Commentor: Europe manages fairly well 
“the average across the EU is 21 weeks for women and three weeks for men” its not about recovery it is about nurturing and protecting babies in a vital stage of their lives while allowing time for employees to adjust their lives to the new normal. Imagine children who get to go into daycare at 1 year old vs a few weeks/months old 
its not about men needing time off- its about children needing their parents 

>Pat I hear you *insert name*, that’s somewhat more reasonable (3 weeks). 26 (for the husband) weeks is ridiculous. Those people that need that should not have kids..

I am a 42f, no degree, live in a VHCOL place.  I owned and operated a court transcription business for around 15 years.  Did data entry and retail prior to that.

Got into tech by learning to build my own website, then my own business production software with VBA in MS Access.  Worked 80-100 hour weeks for years doing this alongside moneymaking activities.  Liked it so much, I wanted to do it full time.  

So I got officially into tech in October 2019, graduated from a 9-month bootcamp in June 2020.  After 3 months and 300-ish apps, I got my first SWE job at a startup. A year and a few months in, I got promoted to SWE II.

A couple months after that, around 250 apps later, I got another mid-level SWE job paying double my previous one.  I had been winding it down already, but officially closed my business at this point in time.

Throughout these now five years, I read a tech book approximately every two weeks, studied them as if I were in school.  

So I built up a lot of knowledge doing this.  I constantly asked my managers for feedback, kept up on the roadmap, and prepped for every 1:1 so I could study whatever the company needed me to know and do whatever they needed done.  And to a great degree, I used what I learned, stretched myself and grew.  

I know VB, JS, Kotlin, Java, Ruby, Scala, and others.  I am a full-stack dev but have mostly focused on backend.

Then in January 2024, I got laid off.  Have applied for around 700 SWE jobs, and 100 ""other"" jobs, or jobs that will pay the bills, relevant to my previous really old experience.  All of the SWE jobs, I meet 80-100% of the qualifications.  

I have good personal branding, a nice video introducing myself on my portfolio site, and I built the whole site from scratch, including the player and the video.  The video has captions and chapters.

Out of those SWE apps, I've gotten around 70 interviews.  Over half of them closed the role before hiring anyone.  The remaining half, I made it to various stages where they said effectively, ""You did just fine, but we picked someone else."" A few of them, admittedly I bombed, but not many.

I fractured 9 ribs and got a mild concussion in an accident in June, had to recover from that and withdraw from 8 interview processes.

Now I'm healed, but my unemployment ran out a couple weeks ago, and my savings is gone.  Lower-level jobs won't hire me even when I target my resume and leave out my SWE experience.  They ask for references, and all the refs I have are very good/excellent professional refs, but are also all SWE refs.

I am having a hard time keeping it together now mentally.

This week, I did an onsite for a company which is in the same industry I've worked in now for a couple years.  

Without realizing until later interviews, during star stories, I described to them problems I solved that they currently have.  Literally I have solved several of their current major problems before and executed the entire SDLC on the solutions for them, design through implementation and beyond -- maintenance/on-call, built the monitoring and alerting, etc.

I did my final onsite with them this week.  All the people I interviewed with had been there 3 months or less, even the director of eng, despite the company being around for several years.  One had been there 5 weeks.

I had a recruiter intro, a hiring manager interview, a tech assessment, then the final onsite of, 1, another coding assessment, 2, a system design, and, 3, a behavioral with the director of eng.

I thought it went well.  Today I heard back from the recruiter.  I was rejected.  The recruiter seemed careful to use language which heavily implied they disagreed with the decision.

They said I was great, that I performed great in every interview, but that they were looking for a stronger coding interview.

They literally said this -- that even though I did a pseudocode solution followed by two actual working coding solutions in 35-ish minutes, they weren't happy with that and wanted more.  

I have literally done this problem before in real work on a much larger scale, and I not only said that but I was able to talk about how I applied my knowledge to it in real life.  I mean, from my perspective, I nailed it as much as I possibly could have.

The recruiter was very apologetic and seemed very disappointed, said (unsolicited) that whoever did pick me up would be very lucky to have me.

Two other companies said they wanted me to move forward to onsite and then, before we scheduled, they contacted me again and said they sent offers to other people and wouldn't be doing any onsite with me after all.

The last two of the five, I haven't heard back if I made it to onsite yet or not.  But the next step for these two is final onsite.

Out of the 100-ish non-tech jobs I applied for, I got one single interview, nailed it (you're just gonna have to take my word for this), still got rejected.

If I don't get a paycheck by the end of the month I am screwed.  I am so frustrated right now, it is just unreal.  Usually I have a fairly sunny and positive disposition, and  it is becoming harder and harder to keep it up.  I am just so sick of all this rejection and time wasting.

Hopefully something comes up.  idk how we are gonna get through it if nothing comes up -- live in our car, I guess, and do interviews from my phone internet/hotspot.

I'm done ranting for now.  Thanks if you read this far.

Update:  I gave my backstory here because part of my feeling frustrated about this is that it took me 300 apps for my first SWE job out of bootcamp, 250 for the mid, and now I am up to 800 looking for anything -- junior, mid, senior.  I wasn't talking about myself to brag.  It was about comparing myself to myself.  Really didn't think I needed to spell that out, but I guess I do.  

It is very frustrating to know it took me 300 4-5 years ago and now here, with 4-5 more years of experience, I am at 800 and counting, getting laid off despite doing everything I described (and more) to do well at my job, do right by my company and colleagues, etc.

One of the remaining two companies I was waiting to hear back from rejected me but said they wanted to contact me when they are hiring again.

I did get an AI training job using my pre-tech experience, with an unlimited amount of work so far, at $15-$20 an hour, contracting, and another hotel called me back, but can't get me in to the next interview stage until August 20th.

So we'll see.  Might scrape by for a while.  Gonna have to stop applying to SWE jobs and work 16-hour days, but it might work out.

I am not gonna reply to some of these folks because I don't see the point.  I quoted my rejection email here verbatim and people still didn't read it.",user_157,155,31

Hi-

Graduated 6 years ago and have been in different roles as a data analyst and now a software developer. I do work a good job and am lucky to work remote, don’t make tons (base at $95K) so there’s definitely potential for salary growth. That being said, my current role is also pretty recession proof and has amazing WLB (I am always off by 4) and 5 weeks vacation which is a huge reason to stay for now.

That being said for many reasons I am considering leaving tech and one of the top reasons is due to how much things can suddenly change. I would love to work Big Tech or similar for example and move back to Seattle. But I cannot cope with the idea of scoring a nice paying job, getting my life settled, and then being fired suddenly. Like how tf do you breathe with that looming?

And yes perhaps you are a marketable person, but you have to spend your whole career of 30-40 years networking and making the right connections and selling yourself and skills and idk, all of it just is exhausting to me?

Im looking at jobs in healthcare atm (not tech related) because honestly I am leaning towards finding something I can pour myself into that I can get paid well (like CRNA) and not have to worry whether I’ll have a job in the next quarter.

Sorry for the slight rant, I just want to know how others are dealing with this. I’m 26 and it’s so hard right now for me to see myself in tech for another 30-40 years. ",user_49,152,88

Colleague B said, you mean in an object? 

I said, sorry what do you mean by that? Can you elaborate? 

Colleague B subtly looks around the room like how could I not understand, and repeats his 3 word question…

Colleague A, opens his mouth, scrunches his eyebrows, raises his hands and shrugs his shoulders, rolls his eyes and scoffs audible saying something resembling “wtf do you mean?” in a condescending tone. 

Colleague B asks me to share my screen and explain of which I declined because HOW THE FUCK WOULD I WANT TO SHARE ANY THOUGHTS NOW.  I said nevermind, but after being pushed again by colleague B, 

I said we’ll let me read it again I don’t memorise/keep the component or pr at the top of my head, I speed read colleague As pr again and said, it looks like you’re trying to hack the existing object structure to achieve your goal, so why don’t you make the new object type to pass in only blah blah blah and make blah blah blah optional that way. Of which they both agreed was a good idea. 

Like fuck. Sorry for swearing but seriously. I’m damn tired of this crap. 

It’s not too hard to explain the context of your object comment. This isn’t my goddam work it’s your work, I shouldn’t be treated like this for not being actively across it at all times, not to mention he ignored my initial contribution on GitHub which also got a thumbs up from the tech lead??

It's where a female leader generally speaking is pushed to less high-profile, more dead-end leadership roles, like training interns and new graduates or leading an undervalued division of the company where her role has no growth path. Then, when she complains about wanting more impact or visibility, they go off about the importance of ""molding the minds of the next generation"" or whatever. 

It's kind of like how women often get set up to fail by being put into leadership when things on the project or team are already a hot mess so that the woman is either savior or scapegoat, only it's more like a quasi-maternal role they keep pushing women into.

I just wanted to get some advice. Over the last 12 months, I’ve noticed my manager (female, around early 30s), sometimes says that’s so gay. 

On two occasions I can’t remember the context, as I just get stunned she says it and I’m watching to see if she realises and generally just processing. Once she said it in relation to packing her suitcase for a trip and was talking about packing a dress.

Each time she’s said it on a team meeting, like a stand up for example. I think I’ve seen other people notice, but obviously no one says anything.

I personally think it’s really unprofessional and I find it weird she doesn’t have that awareness. I’ve seen her interact with gay colleagues and she gets on well with them.  I know some people don’t realise it has a negative connotation, but I just wondered what you thought and if you’d say anything?

Personally I am gay, it doesn’t bother me too much, as I know some people don’t mean to say anything bad towards gay people. But it has stopped me from opening up to her about my personal life.

I’m worried if I say anything to her, if she will take it the wrong way? Like “hey I just wanted to let you know, I’ve heard you say this a few times, but just wanted to let you know, these days it’s known more as a not very inclusive phrase).

Over time, our conversations shifted into uncomfortable and invasive territory, becoming increasingly sexual. He asked about my family, dating, and even medical history. Eventually, he revealed that he and his wife were in an open relationship. My boundaries were weak, and I didn’t know how to say no. I believe this vulnerability stemmed from my background as an underprivileged minority.

By the time I realized how serious the situation was, I felt it was too late to report it. I was overwhelmed by emotions, struggling with depression, and experiencing frequent panic attacks. Hearing about yet another employee’s suicide at EY today reminded me just how toxic workplace environments can become. Sometimes the bullying is so subtle that it’s hard to recognize or report. It feels like a slow death by a thousand paper cuts.

If I could go back, here’s what I would do differently:
   
1. **Keep your personal life private.** If someone tries to pry into your personal matters, shut it down immediately. If they persist, don’t hesitate to call them out for being inappropriate.
   
2. **Set clear boundaries between work and life.** Focus on your job, earn your paycheck, and leave work behind when you go home. Avoid post-work drinks or unnecessary socializing with colleagues—keep things professional.
   
3. **Document everything.** Take notes on paper—digital records can mysteriously disappear. I had key documentation about my achievements vanish from my computer right before a review. This goes for any form of harassment too—keep a detailed record. I still have a text message from a VP confirming he was in an open relationship. Why? Because he told me.

4. **Report to HR once you’ve gathered enough evidence.** Then, follow up with them in writing to ensure there’s a record of the discussion.

5. **Be ready to seek legal help if needed.** If HR doesn’t resolve the issue, don’t hesitate to lawyer up.

Bullying and harassment are rampant and insidious in this industry, especially for people of color who lack resources. Stay vigilant and protect yourself. When I confronted the VP about his behavior, he said, “Well there is always another one!”

He joined the company about a month ago and knows nothing about the internal politics or processes or why I do what I do and I see no reason to want to explain myself to him, but he just keeps on meddling in my work even though I have told him to focus on his onboarding. It makes me feel angry and uneasy, and I'm afraid he'd do sth that would destroy his own image in the company.(I've already had to answer to other teams for his reckless actions once) Should I do anything further? What would you do?

Update: So, I had a little chat with his techlead, and tried to find out if he is meddling in her work the way he tries to meddle in mine (without telling her the situation so I won't get her biased) and it seemed like it had not happened to her. I also had a little chat with the guy who had previously worked with him and had actually referred him to us, and he said he had not seen such behaviour from him but he is always a bit too curious about things and asks a lot of questions. 

Then, I gave him a few minor feedbacks about his attitude in group chats (he was making too many jokes, in inappropriate times and in the middle of very serious conversations) and he actually listened and changed his attitude. So I decided to give the ""focus on the job that is asked of you because you'll be judged by that in less than two months"" feedback to him through his techlead and see if it works. 

His techlead talked to him during their one on one session and told him to just focus on technical stuff and being an IC. He welcomed the feedback and things are going very smoothly for now. He had told his techlead that he thinks he might have destroyed his own image in the company and was a bit nervous and upset. 

So I think it was really some kind of on-boarding syndrom, he was trying to make his new work place like his old one, had read a few books on organizational problems and had judged the workplace a little too soon. He was trying to solve problems that did not exist, and was a little rusty in giving feedback, which was starting to look like meddling and had made me (and I later found out, a few other coworkers) a bit unhappy.

We're good for now, and I hope this change of attitude is permanent and he wouldn't just reset after a while :)

Thank you everyone for your helps, every single one of the comments helped me think about and recognize the problem better.",user_170,145,65

The team is not in my domain and I have been really struggling with the subtle dynamics at play here. Some things I'm experiencing:

• Struggling to connect with them while they connect with each other. I'm a 23 yr old woman of color and they are all 35-60 yr old mostly white men. We have very different lifestyles and views. I am not saying I am incapable of connecting with someone who's different than me, but it is true that people who are alike in these factors are more likely to relate to each other than others. The issue stems from the makeup of the team being completely homogenous, hence the invisible formation of a ""boys club"". Their interests, stories, and jokes are not things I naturally resonate with, and I'll try my best but even then I still feel I'll never make the ""cut"" compared to them with each other.

• Not having the domain knowledge and years of experience to be able to participate in hallway work related conversations. I try to stay curious, engaged, and learn, but they often speak a language with each other that I'm just not able to get yet, which creates a further disconnect

• Because of these struggles on both the personal and work side, I have felt treated like an outsider. I have noticed myself being ignored occasionally, and most of them seem to have little interest in talking with me or ""breaking bread"" with me compared to with each other (also probably because it doesnt benefit them politically). Nothing too overt but it definitely makes it all feel worse.

The above has really ruined my self esteem and overall work satisfaction. I have been questioning whether I have the grit, social skills, and extroversion for this job, given how important relationships are for my role. Part of me wants to ""fight"", not give up, and try to prove myself, but the other part is just tired and wants to switch to a different team, especially given that the new domain is not something I'm even particularly interested in. 
Any advice from fellow women here on how to navigate this?

JOB TITLE: Advanced AI Data Trainer

Invisible Technologies uses TRACKING SOFTWARE (Hubstaff) to monitor your desktop and take screenshots every 10 minutes. Hubstaff can also see anything you have in Incognito mode, and any programs/software you have running in the background. They track your keystrokes and mouse movement.

They also want your webcam to be always on in Zoom.

You'd think with their paranoia they would at least provide their workers with company laptops.. but they don't. How surprising.

They pay slave wages of $15, and sell your skills to train AI for tech companies. 

There are NO benefits of any sort. You are a contractor.

They use Wise to pay people in USD, so if you're working outside of the US, be prepared to pay conversion fees and other Wise fees.



ONBOARDING

I applied to them in April 2023. They emailed me May 2024, and rushed the entire onboarding process.

During the 3 hours long onboarding process you find out about their invasive tracking slowly



PROS

The onboarding videos of the owner, Francis Pedraza, obsessively repeating how AI will make everyone ""creative and strategic"" is idiotically amusing



CONS

Slave wages, invasive tracking software, micromanaging, no benefits, no advancement, no work life balance",user_173,142,10

I’ve been searching for a software engineering job for 6 months. 

Two very qualified men in my network with dual Master’s, histories at Amazon and other FAANG, etc. have applied to 1000+ roles in 1 year and 3000+ roles in 4 months, and are both still not employed. 

The market is utterly insane. 

I am at the point where I’d do some very cutthroat things to secure an income and survive. 

After somehow failing an interview last week—with a referral from the hiring manager, a positive first interview with the director of engineering, and finally with another positive interview with a principal engineer who said, when asked directly if he had any hesitation around sending me to the next round, said no, it was looking great—I am in complete despair. 

LinkedIn is full of bot scams, shady contract recruiters asking me to take 33% less than the published hourly, and a few people posting generic LLM-generated content that is either humblebrag (while also scrounging for employment), or personal brand-building to impress all the other bots, apparently. 

I have applied to a couple hundred jobs at this point. Many with referrals. Many with cover letters tailored to the role. I’ve attended networking meetings, meetups, tried to get into a career fair that was at capacity, reached out to a few dozen recruiters directly. 

I keep getting told that it’s not me, it’s the market. 

At this point, I’m getting desperate. I don’t want to live in my car. Or tap my investments or retirement portfolio. 

I’ve emailed a tutoring service to see if they need computer science tutors. I’m considering posting a flyer at some nearby schools or even calling schools to see if they need CS after school program coordinators or teachers. 

I’m not sure what else to do. I don’t want to go into retail or hospitality—these industries would murder me.  I have a bit of social anxiety, and I remember hating every millisecond of retail in college while paying for my degree.

What are you all doing to make ends meet when it appears that no one is hiring? ",user_174,141,78

A bit of a rant and looking for some kinship in this space! Also I am nb but perceived by people as a woman so I hope it's okay I post here. I use they/them pronouns if you need to know that for replying :)
""""""

Sooo we all know the job market stinks right now, that's not new news. But literally every rejection I am getting after my technical interviews is, ""the team decided to go with someone more technical,"" or something along those lines. 

I am starting to think it is because of how I'm perceived as an AFAB person. I have, of course, experienced sexism in this field for years but have been fortunate in better markets to be able to keep finding good teams.

I've been working as a SWE for 10+ years and it is so frustrating that no matter how much constant knowledge growing I do, I continue to be deemed not technical enough. Even when I'm going for strictly frontend roles where I highlight my creativity AND technical prowess, I still get told this. 

In contrast, I have taught online courses and helped 1000+ people upskill as SWEs through my teaching but yet IM STILL NOT TECHNICAL ENOUGH.

(Side note, I do highlight that I like to demystify technical concepts and make them more approachable, which I guess makes me sound less technical sometimes??)

Am I being paranoid? I'm truly here just to feel validated or realize I still need to keep upskilling. Tell me I'm wrong, please please please 😳

I keep feeling like with the market as it is, there is more of a push towards the old guard and teams are getting less diverse from all perspectives. Probably too early for there to be data on this - but I'm dreading the tr'mp era making it even worse as more companies shut down dei initiatives.

I fixed that shit to the point we even received almost double our budget the next fiscal year. I think I’m a great Project Manager. I outperformed TWO PMs who joined the project and left and who both had 15+ years of experience. 

I finally ended up quitting my position because of my manager and the architect on the project. I mean this architect sucked so badly he was yelling at the customer in calls because he didn’t understand the requirements. He would belittle everyone in the world and my manager just kept letting it happen. The sexism. The cultural bullshit. It was just too much. As an Indian woman who grew up in the US, I was just so tired of Indian cultural BS that was coming out. He thought he could get away with treating me like a child, because I was unmarried at the time. He kept belittling me in meetings. And my manager did NOTHING. It just got out of hand. So I finally quit after sobbing into my husband’s arms like a baby.

My team lead is a technical architect and he might also be the clearest example I’ve seen in awhile of failing upwards. 

He’s pinging us early today because an address validation component isn’t working in an org us lowly devs don’t have access to. The first issue is that this component should be prefilled via a process that another team created. The component itself is also something that we did not build. 

I ask him if we should loop in the respective teams since these are not our components. No response. Demo is in 2 hrs but he wants us to go into a lower org, create certain records in a way to trigger said process the other team built to see if we can recreate the issue. None of us know how to do this so he sends us a video that is over an hour long to watch so we can do this. You know, with enough time to spare to also debug his issue and fix it before the demo. 

In the meantime, he starts pinging us about another place we are using the address validation component. He says it should also be prefilling an address and it’s not. Well, I worked on the components downstream of that one and I know for sure what he’s saying is bs. It doesn’t prefill. The user sets it. It’s always blank upon record creation until the user sets it. We prefill *options* the user can select but we don’t make a default selection. I tell him this.

I explain that if he can save and verify the address it’s working as expected. He responds that it’s wrong because it’s displaying “weird letters” as the country code. I suggest that perhaps it’s defaulting to a different country code in this org but that if we can utilize its functionality then it’s working. He loses his shit about bad user experience (and by that he means: it’s different! Therefore my small brain can’t make sense of it) and how I’m wrong. Like, I understand that he wants it to default to US, but 1) not our component; 2) this is a tiny minuscule detail he will demo. Surely he can smooth talk right over that and make a note that it’s a bug that should be addressed after the demo. The component still works. He can still end to end. 

This is where Joe jumps in. Joe shows him a screen shot of country codes and points out exactly what I just said: it’s defaulting to an unfamiliar one. 

“Thank you Joe, that is a logical answer!” 

I mean, it’s exactly what I said but he just showed him a picture. As a technical architect it never occurred to this guy to go check that himself instead of punching down on his team? Also, wtf? My answer where I suggest the same damn thing is not logical? 

Joe is actually the guy who implemented the address validation component across our teams components but he was silent all morning till he swooped in with his screen shot. I’m also 100% certain he won’t stand up for me to him. Lastly, yesterday this team lead repeatedly tried to give credit for my work to Joe. I corrected him and he still did it. The work he referenced was stuff that Joe and I both used for some of our sprint work. I literally built the whole thing out, and in the process did a huge chunk of his story as well as mine. All Joe did was pass it some input values. But yep! He totally built it!

I paused my notifications and signed off. This is not the first time he has lost his shit on us before a demo. Not engaging with an abusive, sexist team lead who insults me when I try to help. F all of them. ",user_182,133,30

I don’t know if it’s because Networking is intimidating but since the beginning of my career as a analyst it’s always been this way. 

I have the certifications, working on the degree and the experience otherwise they wouldn’t have hired me. I did similar work in the military. 

I use to think it was because of my race, but me and another guy who’s new are the same race. We’re both black. Our trainer, manager and most of the staff is all white but the team is diverse. 

There was another woman already on the team who I was paired with, because I guess you know we were women, and she was very nice but it didn’t seem like they were giving her much work so training was lacking. 

I knew coming into this role you typically have to advocate for yourself and volunteer for work as a newbie. The job is also remote so we do a lot of zoom training. 

Whenever I engage in any unrelated or work related conversations that my male coworkers are having ( my one female coworker is on another shift now) to relate they always go quiet or it feels like I’m not welcomed. 

Most of the men I work with are married, I’m not but I’m partnered. I act extremely professional, I often soften my voice as I was always told it’s deep for a woman but I speak firmly.

I volunteer for work, and hold my own until I need help as I’m still learning the system. 

I never attempt to be “a know it all” even if the other new guys do, and they do alot. They’re always hijacking the learning sessions to provide knowledge from another job and no one seems to mind, but when I ask a clarifying question it’s met with just this perceived malice. The tone changes and that says a lot as this is a remote job. (I’ve worked remote and onsite) over the years. 

When I do ask for help I’m always given a flat answer but anytime my other new coworker does he’s given a complete answer along with the reasons why and why it doesn’t work.

I’ve been in IT since I got out of the military, so I’m no stranger to male dominated spaces, but it’s always been like this. Immediately the other guys were welcomed and given resources, it took them 2 weeks after I started to even acknowledge my requests and Yes I asked. 

No one really woke up and decided to do training sessions until the new guy came. He didn’t have to do anything, even though I had to message and beg why?

They joke and are extremely friendly with the new guy but with me it’s always this cold demeanor.

2. Did you find your path in college or years after college? 

3. Was there ever a pivot you decided to then transition into the tech field? 

If so, how was that process and what helped you get there? 

4. Did you get a degree from a university in CS or anything related and then find a job? Or did you get a degree in something else and then transitioned? 

If so, what were those steps and how successful was that transition in terms of time and investment? 

5. If being in your 30s, 40s, 50s and single really all that bad women set it out to be? 

- if so, does that mean that we have to settle with men just for the sake of companionship? 

- did you decide to stay alone? 

6. Do you feel like now bc you’re financially well off you don’t need a man? Or how do you choose your potential partners? 

7. What are your non negotiables with your daily life, men and work? 

I hate how many stigmas are on women. Anything yall may have, I know there’s millions of things we can talk about here. But I want to open up the topic so we can all discuss how to understand how women live life of all ages and their experiences, with stories to tell. Preferably stories that in hindsight made complete sense to them individually. 

I have so many questions but so far, these are mine for right now. I am tired of how society has shaped us and how diminishing the feminine energy has gotten. We’re so much greater. I want to hear your story. Please share.

Here’s the story:  I’ve worked as a 44 yr old remote IT project Mgr for 4 1/2 years at my company.  My boss has changed at least 4 times in my tenure there. My current boss (33 yr old VP of Ops - she is a young brand new VP by the way) has been taking over my projects for the past 2 years.  I hadn’t outright called her out on it (stupid move on my part)  because I figured she was the new VP and wanted to prove herself and get her arms wrapped around her new department.  So I let it ride. 

As she has taken over my projects I asked for more work only to be thrown project coordinator tasks.  No shade to project coordinator work but I’m a seasoned IT PM with my PMP and get paid as such.  It is hard to build a business case for promotions or raises if I’m only given Project coordinator work.

I did bring this to my boss’s attention and requested to be added to other projects.  Sometimes she would have me sit in on other projects but would not give me any role or responsibilities.  Finally I asked her for feedback on my quality of work and if she had any suggestions on areas for growth.  I figured if she’s taking my projects away then I must not be hitting the mark somewhere.  She said I was doing a great job and had no feedback to provide.

So I decided to “sell” my PM skills to other departments, and literally went to each Department Head asking how I could provide support.  The Applications and Engineering departments jumped at the chance to work with me.  I’ve received a few projects with them but it’s not enough for a full days work.  I’m bored and not growing career wise or financially.  

Feels like they are pushing me out.  What do you think?  I’ve already started my job search, networking with PM organizations to keep my skills up to date, and working my professional network.  But I’m feeling burnt out that I waited so long for things to change, didn’t speak up and advocate for myself, and things just seemed to get worse.",user_190,128,49

I'm a minority product designer that has been in tech for the past six years across Series D startups to now a big enterprise. I posted my story in r/Layoffs and went viral but I was laid off the day after launching a mobile app for a startup, have had managers that were bible thumping pastors outside of work that thought homosexuality was a sin (craziest experience) and no amount of therapy has been able to heal all the trauma I have dealt with. Earlier this year, I ended up settling with a company over a wrongful termination case for 33.3%. I never paid my attorney anything and he took care of me from the initial demand letter, let me know by phone whenever they had a number in mind and eventually we settled this past summer. It was a super quick turnaround as I assumed they didn't want to do discovery on my whistleblowing to HR about ADA discrimination. It was my first time doing anything like this but I really needed to as I felt super wronged and was really spiraling.

I spent some time off of work before taking a contract job to build out a side project that was really more of a way to heal from my traumatic layoff and wrongful terminations. I was having dinner with a good lawyer friend of mine and after a few drinks - we had an idea where we could ""match"" tech workers who are actively being discriminated against with ""vetted"" attorneys in different states that we personally know. I think a lot of people just let things go but it was so cathartic for me to get my justice (hung both settlement checks above my air conditioner so I can own that trauma) and wanted to do the same for people. We launched on Linkedin a week ago and have had some truly appalling cases come up through signups but reinforced to me that what I was doing was right.

Obviously we are pre product market fit but is this something that appeals to people on this sub? What are some things that I should watch for? If you're interested feel free to reach out to me, but I'm mainly looking for feedback on if this resonates with people here. Or am I encouraging people to do something that most would never do?

Work events and drinking.,"So I'm a woman in tech in nontechnical role (sales). And very often there are men in my team and men I sell to. I always look at myself as a girl's girl and also a 'cool girl' and can be with the boys when the situation calls for it. I feel more comfortable with women in general but can handle guys and guy chat.

  
Last night after a work event, originally at the table there were 3 women and 7 men. At the end of the night, it was myself and 3 men one of which is someone I work with. We are all married. They have kids and I don't. They started basically complaining about their non-existent sex life.

  
Looking back I feel like I should have just left when I started to feel uncomfortable but at the time I wanted to challenge my colleague's way of thinking and have more empathy for his wife who is heavily pregnant right now.

  
I felt during that conversation, that the client felt weirded out maybe and at some points they also tried to stop my colleague from talking any more. We all have been drinking for hours at this point.

  
So my questions:

\- do I bring this up with my colleague that that was unprofessional and really should not talk about that to me? Or to clients!?

\- if I talk about it, do I say i in person or teams or a chat?

  
Moving forward I probably will just go home earlier before the conversation turns into this but I'm annoyed as I wanted to build a rapport with one of the clients that's why I stayed.

  
Help a gal out and yes I have learnt from this people pleasing exercise so please be nice.

I have a technical background: I did a CS undergrad / masters which was almost pure coding, worked briefly as an SWE and then transitioned into PM where I've been for last 2-3 years. I specialized in AI at school and worked on AI products both as an SWE and PM.

At this new company, I can't speak in meetings without being interrupted or corrected. This is happening constantly, just today it happened twice where I started to ask a question but was immediately interrupted by a male engineer and told that my understanding of what we were discussing was incorrect, then he proceeded to re-explain to me everything he just said. This engineer isn't a jerk – he's quite a nice person and is very well-respected across the team. He's not the only one who does this to me – I'm finding that every time I speak up, or ask questions, someone will jump in, interrupt me and then re-explain the thing I was bringing up as if I didn't understand anything at all. But I DO understand. I listen keenly, I understand all the tech they're discussing, and occasionally I have a question because I'd like to verify my understanding of things.

I can't tell what's gone wrong here:  
1) they've all come to the conclusion that I'm not technical, or I'm incompetent, and therefore when they listen to me they jump off that assumption and are overzealous to correct perceived errors of mine. Basically, it's my fault and I need to prove myself technically to win their trust.   
2) it's just bad team culture and this is not my fault. The did warn me during interviews that there are lots of strong personalities.   
This is ruining my confidence, and now I just shut up after someone's interrupted me, because I wonder if maybe I am wrong or not understanding and I shouldn't continue talking and embarrass myself further. 

I don't think it's purely because I'm a woman. The Director of Product who sits in on and often leads these meetings is a woman, and she does not get treated like this.

I've never had this much trouble communicating with others before. I went into PM specifically because everyone I know says that communication is one my strengths, I know it. I've lived in multiple countries, speak several languages, have worked with multiple technical teams of all backgrounds – and I have never encountered an entire team that has spoken down to me like this. I anticipate there will be folks who advise me to find a new job, but the market is brutal and I've just come off a long period of unemployment. I'm in a financial position where I just have to make this work, but I'm not sure how much longer I can bear being routinely condescended to and humiliated.

There have been times where I’ve wanted to quit and find a different job.  There have been times where I’ve been made to feel less than capable, less than talented, where I’ve been sexually harassed, openly discriminated against and treated very unfairly.  I have worked at companies that have supported me and companies where throwing your colleagues under the bus is pretty standard practice.  

When I was talking to one of my friends who is a vet tech, she was telling me that she wanted to get into technology and become a project manager.  I started to think that maybe it’s just all jobs that suck.  My friend hates her job and thinks that transitioning to technology would be a good industry to pivot to.  I have always admired her due to her steadfast dedication to a job helping animals.  From my perspective I feel like I’m doing all of this just for a check whereas she has some kind of moral purpose behind it.  however, she feels like the pay is not worth all of the mental and emotional trauma of working with sick and injured animals and wants to transition to something where that doesn’t happen.  

As an example, I started looking into the statistics around nursing and healthcare jobs.  according to one of the first links on Google 60% of nurses want to change careers soon.  Nurses are one of the most disrespected positions in healthcare. They are not listen to by doctors. They are abused by patients.  Some of them develop, toxic and detrimental coping mechanisms to put up with the load of working in healthcare.  

When I was talking to my tattoo artist, she was telling me that she faced actual sexual abuse in the workplace and that workplace hazing seemed to be a part of her apprenticeship.  Talking to my artist friends, they say they love their job, but all of the marketing, creating content to gain exposure and mass producing their work for quick consumption is deleterious to their spirit.  

I don’t wanna sit here and say no one enjoys their job and every job is bad.  However, it seems like every industry has its faults..  from healthcare to veterinary work to engineering and computer science I think it might just be that women’s labor is not valued. Women are not respected in the workplace because they are not respected.  I don’t know whether to accept this and try to make peace with it or if I should get violently angry at how deeply unfair everything seems to be.  I know that the first option is the most productive and probably won’t result in jail time or fines.  

What are your thoughts?   Do you have anything you want to add to this conversation?  Frankly, I am fed up of being treated poorly by my employers and at the same time I know that I need to accept these things if I want to pay my bills and eat for the month.

I'm on a team whose job is to work on initiatives for the enterprise. I am literally the only SE on a team of 5. I do documentation, I create reference architecture, libraries, roll out plans and even take the place of an architect because we had one that left the team and it was decided not to hire a new one because I'm already performing those duties. Another SE is a candidate for SE5 and his entire tenure has been focused on migrating us to GitHub and his role has been framed as being above and beyond, having enterprise impact and working to develop business strategy. So the existing SE5s get a pass for not having impact due to being burden by their roles, but for me, my accomplishments have been framed as par for the course because it's my job. I'm just tired of fighting tooth and nail to prove my worth. I'm well known, everyone said at calibrations I'm the best of the best.

","Basically the title. I’m mid 30s, about 5 years into my tech career and my first two roles were amazing. Took my current gig because it paid double that of my last role and seemed like an amazing opportunity; I’ve been in it two years.

Upon starting, it became immediately apparent I would have zero training in this role and would basically be figuring things out as I go; which was a surprise to me considering the company is a household name. But I pushed through because, again: good opportunity and high pay.

I’ll spare you the details but my issues are the usual ones you’ll see people complain about here: extremely micromanaging boss, spread way too thin, was handed being on call nights and weekends even though that wasn’t part of the original deal, etc. 

For the last year, I’ve suddenly been having health problems I’ve not had before: heart related things (which terrifies me), insomnia because I stay up all night worrying something will break and I’ll be blamed, chronic UTIs, GI issues and my mental heath condition that was perfectly well managed has never been worse. I wake up and vomit every single morning from the anxiety of having to go into this job. I’ll add that in I’m therapy and on medication and both my therapist and my regular doctor think I need to get out.

But I don’t know what to do. I know I’m so lucky to have this job and that the market is bad so I feel guilty/scared and stay. I have a friend who is trying to get me on in a much less stressful tech role elsewhere that wouldn’t hurt my resume…but would pay like $15k less a year.

I don’t know what to do. I’m a mom and definitely need the money, but I’m falling apart here. Can anyone wiser than me tell me if it’s worth leaving a toxic high paying job for a lower salary one? I appreciate any help. ",user_206,117,98

One of my colleagues (we’ll call him *Bob*), is 62M, and he’s been with the company for 30 years. For someone who works in tech, *Bob* really doesn’t like change. He absolutely hates anything to do with AI, automation, or modernizing systems. He’s been doing infrastructure for more than three decades, but honestly, the whole system looks like it’s stuck in 1995. Despite that, I’ve always respected him, and I’ve been upfront with him about my career goals since I started.

Bob and I have had many conversations about the history of this place, and how so many managers have come and gone without anyone ever telling him what’s happening. He just gets told, “This is your new person you report to,” with no warning or discussion. I thought we had a connection. I’ve always tried to be transparent with him because I know he’s been left out of the loop in the past, so I wanted to give him a heads-up.

Recently, I took a risk and put forward a proposal to be in a more senior role. While that was declined, I was offered a role that’s more of an “in-between” position. To be honest, it’s not much different from what I’m already doing, but at least I’d be getting paid the correct amount for my responsibilities. After the meeting, an co worker asked how it went. I simply said that the meeting went well. It wasn’t a big announcement—just me giving him a heads-up since *Bob* has often been left out of the loop on things. This happened **literally 5 minutes** after I walked out of the meeting.

Well, shortly after, *Bob* goes behind my back to *John* and complains, asking if he’s going to have to report to me now. He also made it clear he wasn’t happy about it. So, *John* pulls me into a meeting and accuses me of “gossiping” and acting like I’m now *Bob*’s boss, like I’m somehow acting superior to him—which I would NEVER do. He told me I was being unprofessional, lacked judgment, and basically humiliated me with his words and tone of voice. It felt like all the work I’ve done for the past six months—taking on extra tasks from *John*, using my skills and achievements to get things over the line—didn’t matter. It was all blown out the window because of this one situation. I totally owned my mistake and acknowledged that maybe I shouldn’t have said anything, but there is a way of professionally telling someone off, and this was NOT it. He didn’t even let me explain my side of the story. It felt like *John* was more worried about hurting *Bob*’s ego than getting the facts straight.

And here’s the part that’s really eating away at me: I honestly don’t think this would have happened if I were male or at least a white female. I’m so done with fighting for a seat at the table. Every single time I achieve even a tiny accomplishment in the tech field, I get shoved right back by a man who gets handed everything. If I leave, the men will win. But if I stay, who knows how else I’ll get backstabbed and scrutinized for every little thing I do.

For context, I’ve always told *Bob* that I’m here to support him as much as he supports me. He has great ideas that often get brushed aside, and I’ve been his spokesperson more than once, pushing his ideas and helping bring them to life. He’s even thanked me for it many times. I thought we had a good connection, but clearly, I was wrong. Now I feel like I’m being painted as this arrogant person who’s trying to step over him, which couldn’t be further from the truth.

The worst part? Now I’m not even sure I want the role anymore, especially after the way *John* treated me. He didn’t give me the benefit of the doubt and completely disrespected me in that meeting. I never expected that from him. Is he being egotistical? It seemed like he was more interested in protecting *Bob*’s feelings than actually understanding what happened.

On the flip side, the executive who would be my new manager, *Sarah*, approached me afterward and asked what happened. She actually listened to my side and gave me some feedback, saying it was probably a bit premature to mention anything to *Bob*, especially since he’s quite hierarchical. I took that feedback professionally, and we discussed it. She also asked if *Bob* was okay now, and I told her that he had sent me two apology texts—one last night and one this morning—for his reaction. She said that’s good, but now I’m left feeling unsure about the whole situation.

Was I wrong for telling *Bob* the meeting went well? Should I have kept it to myself until everything was finalized? Now my promotion is up in the air, and honestly, I’m questioning whether I even want it anymore after how *John* treated me. AITA?",user_208,115,57

I have 15 years of tech experience, mostly as a software engineer. I've worked on a lot of different tech stacks and technologies over the years, so I'm the prime example of ""Jack of all trades but master of none"". I'm also a mom of two young children which I believe has really harmed my career (and I'm ok with that - my children absolutely come first!)

I'll start with the bad news. It really is a tough job market out there for tech. It's the worst I've ever seen since graduating in 2008 at the height of the Great Recession. I'm not sure if it's worse than that or not. I'm going to say it's probably not quite that bad yet, at least for now. I have had countless rejections and non-responses from companies. 

The good news is that I am getting some calls back for jobs that I'm overqualified for. They are either paying less than I'm worth or they require me to be in the office some or all of the time, or both. I haven't gotten a job offer yet, but I'm still pretty early in the process after getting laid off at the end of April. I have had a few interviews and multiple things are currently in the pipeline! I got recruited for a very high end well paid job that I think I'm going to reject because it's not a good fit. I can already tell it's going to be extremely demanding and I can't do that at this point in my life with two little ones. But I'm still flattered that they reached out to me!

Coworkers at the same level as me are super condescending, talk down today. Tools and technologies I've worked with for years getting explained at a base level. 

I call out the condescending behaviours but they are always justified by higher ups as the other people just trying to help, they are just making sure all the bases are covered. Today a colleague explained to me (in a thread comment) how an API works and I just broke down behind my screen I'm just full of anger, disappointment and I'm sick of this behaviour.

I'm a senior test automation engineer who has written hundreds if not thousands of API tests and I'm sick of this crap. It's always going to be dismissed, I'm seen as aggressive and hostile when I call it out so I ignore it until it weighs on me too much to ignore. 

I'm sick of being treated like crap. I know I can move workplace but from my experience there is always a few that will treat me like this everywhere, it's a systematic issue, the constant mansplaining. I don't want the additional stress of having to upskill and learn a new set of domain specific things but the scales are definitely tipping. Going into a meeting with people around me who are biased who have already predetermined my technical ability before even speaking to me, without asking or baselining is frustrating. 

I feel like when I bring these issues to management I am seen as problematic so I've learned to keep quiet as possible but I also will not be mistreated, I respect myself too much for that.

I am thinking of dropping out of the tech sector, I'm thick skinned, I can handle myself and I don't want to be a statistic but I'm tired. Oh my god I am tired and sick of this, is it like this until retirement? 

Don't get me wrong I work with some absolutely brilliant engineers and I try to focus on the positive and foster those meaningful working relationships but the select few ruin it and wreck havoc on my mental health, imposter syndrome etc. It's making me regret choosing a career in tech even though I used to be so passionate.

At a recent 1:1 I was asked ""are these issues happening for anyone else?"" I am the only woman on the development team. It's like the issues aren't real if they can't see them or they are not experiencing them. I just get told Mr XYZ isn't trying to be disrespectful, I never said he was but the constant condescending behaviour speaks volumes.

I feel like I am only one person and it's easy to silence me, I feel deflated like I can never influence change; it just backfires and serves to demonise me or I'm seen as oversensitive. I'm not oversensitive, I'm not crazy, I'm not negative but I'm dismissed and made to feel like this everyday. 

I have a good salary and good WFH perks that I don't want to lose and I think it wouldn't be seamless to achieve the same benefits without being on the market a while to make sure a move is what I want it to be but I don't know how long I can stick this out. ",user_217,110,63

My company is around 80% men and it does feel like a ""boy's club"", despite the fact our product is female-focused.

At drinks after dinner, I was speaking to two male colleagues and out of the blue one says ""have you ever done porn?"". Naturally, I replied no, why would you ask me that? He then goes on to ask if I would ever do porn and why not. Then I said that's a very strange question, would you ask a male colleague that?

He was like yes I would, why are you being so sensitive? We were literally right next to multiple male colleagues who he obviously did not ask the same question to. As a side note - this was  completely out of the blue as we were having a completely unrelated discussion just prior to this. 

I continue to push back and ask why he was asking me this and then him and another colleague basically berate me about how I'm being sensitive. It's almost as is this guy wanted to see if he could make me crack.

I'm proud of myself that I held it together and kept calmly asking why he was asking this, why he felt it was relevant and staying neutral and emotionless as he was obviously trying to get a reaction out of me. I then left the team event and went home and only then it hit me what had happened.

It was so incredibly degrading and aggressive I almost can't believe it happened. I usually have a pretty thick skin for this kind of stuff but what hurt the most was the realisation that no matter what I achieve or how hard I work, I will never be seen as equal in my male colleagues' eyes.

I think the reason this guy went in on me as earlier in the night we had a debate about one work-appropriate topic (which was a friendly debate from my perspective) and I think he was pissed off that I had ""won"", aka made an argument that he didn't have a response to.

Yesterday I spent most of the day crying but today I'm doing better. I know I can't say anything to anyone at work apart from one close female peer as these guys are close friends with the founders and it would 100% have a negative impact on my career, and I will NOT let these dickheads affect me even more.

But according to my boss it's a much different story. At every moment, he mentioned ""httphei MOSTLY worked on this"". He'll throw in a "" we"" here and there, and explain the project as if he's been there. On a project that he has literally never even touched, and only laid eyes on 4 times.

I feel bad for letting this get to me, but this has been consistent, where my boss refuses to tell people how much work I really am doing. Because of those ""mostly"" comments, he gets commended by our higher-ups when they see my work. Am I just overreacting? I've considered addressing it but I don't know if it's even worth it.",user_224,103,38

Hi I am 30 years old female. I have started my It career as a network admin 2 and half years back with no background in tech. I have used an opportunity in a corporate project where they will take you, hire you and educate you on the subject.

I was looking forward very much working in IT. But it is getting to me and I have to put it out somewhere or else I am going to blow up . 

It is really hard to be in a male group as a woman. 
There is constant I mean constant objectifing of women around in our firm or elsewhere, stupid jokes. Not the mention they had the time of day talking about what panties I was wearing even before I got the job. I Have found  out about it in a group chat history. 
Now they wanted to go on a 2 day plus teambuilding somewhere far in nature renting out a house . 
I really found it unconfortable and said that i couldnt come . On my first teambuilding with other teams one of the main engineers was making sure we are drinking a lot and then he was asking us to go dancing while he had ring on his finger and on his social "" happily married"" status.
Honestly I feel that even if I would bring to this team a golden pig ( take extra tasks, do more work , still they would underpressiate my work , and just by how they joke around me  or behind my back , my work and efforts will never be appresiated and I can kiss a promotion goodbay.

I am planing to let company pay for certifications. And after that I am going to disappear. 

Dear readers tell me , should I have done something different?

I was in the middle of buying a house, so I kinda had to take the first job I could find. I was actively panicking about tech interviews, I took the first job that offered to hire me without a tech test, and six months later I quit because I couldn't stand their culture or way of working (very micromanaging, code monkey kind of culture, and everyone except me was a white male in their late 50s). 

I swore I'd take my time to find a job this time, but I was in the middle of my MSc dissertation. One thing led to another and I ended up agreeing to a senior position with a small startup. Things were a bit boring with them day to day, and the technology wasn't my most favourite thing (in fact I didn't have experience in any of the tech but the manager was very nice and he and I agreed a lot on ways of working, etc), but the team was kind and I was quickly picking up things I never thought I'd be capable of working with. 

Things were looking great as my manager was drafting a plan to get me to a managerial position, even training me for it with courses, conferences, etc. It looked like it was actually happening this time. Then out of nowhere after lunch one day I got a call from someone from the C-suite telling me they were letting me and my manager go because of the team's performance. I thought it was weird, and the reasons they gave me also were not very clear. At some point they mentioned that I had advocated for plan A which hadn't worked (even though I had actually advocated for the contrary 🥲) and mentioned that I didn't have experience in the technologies they used. Which I said.... they knew when they hired me, but now I have around 8 months of exp and was managing it really well. They didn't really care much.

It was really shocking, and I think it was unfair, given the reasons they gave me. Like they had no idea if I did good work or not. And it was right before a holiday I had planned since the beginning. So I went on my holiday, came back and I'm studying on the technologies I have the most experience in to remember things I haven't used in more than half a year so I can land a job. But I'm so disillusioned with everything. 

Every time I liked a job, I was let go seemingly at random. Each time I am left angrier, and more tired, and more scared of interviews. And now I have to explain to recruiters why my last two positions lasted less than a year.

I vowed to take my time this time, and take two or three months of just studying so I would feel prepared. But a month has passed already and I've only read one book on Typescript (super helpful, but it was only 300 pages and it took me a month...). I am not motivated at all. I am so bored of programming. I feel like having 10 years in the industry + a masters degree in Computing + speaking two languages are worth absolutely nothing. 

From the get go, I only want remote positions (I am in the countryside in the UK) and I think companies are starting to resent that. I am also a woman, look younger than my age, I'm neurodivergent, and I'm an immigrant. I feel vulnerable, and tired, and can't say I am putting my best into it anymore, most days I struggle to find the motivation to even read a little bit about programming, let alone practice for interviews.

1. One huge issue is that HR departments in many of these big tech companies are set up to protect the company from liability, not their employees. In fact, 67% of women who work in tech have said that they don’t trust how their company would handle allegations of harassment. Of the women who did report the harassment to HR, 85% said the harasser faced no repercussions, and 45% said they themselves were punished in some way for reporting it.

2. This type of differential treatment is rampant in the tech industry, with 70% of women admitting to being treated differently due to their gender (compared to only 11% of men). It’s not just coming from investors in high level meetings, either; female employees and other minorities in any position within their company have to deal with hostility from a variety of angles, and the issue is not getting any better. Of the women surveyed, 76% said that they had been perpetually harassed by a fellow employee (a 13% increase since 2017), and 42% said that it was by a supervisor. ",user_230,102,48

I try to balance my knowledge and experience with the understanding that I make mistakes and won’t always be “right.” Is that not a leader?

I'm a long-time tech industry vet who has been working on a stack of protocols for anonymous/pseudonymous and zero-pii apps. I read some months back that if the Rs win this election they might start using data from period trackers to do nefarious things to people who get and track periods. I'm not part of that group, but I am part of the group who cares about the government doing nefarious things so I put a period tracker on my list of things to build.

I, like many of you I'd imagine, was hopeful that I'd have some more time before having to build it, but here we are. 


So here's how it works. Some open source buddies and I built an auth protocol called [Sessionless](https://www.github.com/planet-nine-app/sessionless). Sessionless lets people create and maintain accounts without any personally identifying information. No email, no name, no birthdate, no nothing. We can end2end encrypt whatever needs to be stored off device, and there's nothing shareable with any snoopers.

I took a look at some of the supposed ""safe"" apps from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1gkybhr/delete_your_period_apps_now/), and since they all monetize via advertising, everyone who uses them has well funded companies trying their best to track them. 

If you have interest feel free to dm me or post here. All are welcome regardless of skill level, job title, or discipline. 

This won't be a commercial product. It will be a FOSS one provided as a public good. Should it become popular enough that I can't afford to run the infrastructure for it we'll cross the monetization bridge then.

**Edit** Thank you all for the thoughtful comments. I'm going to go ahead with starting this project. For those of you who said you were interested in helping I'll dm you directly. So far the requirements seem to be:

* Local First (LoFi) or Local Only
* Obfuscation (non-obvious name and purpose)
* No biometrics, or at least options for no biometrics

My plan for the weekend is to write up these reqs with a plan, start the repo, discuss stack, and research that open source one to see if it can give us a head start.",user_233,97,36

About me: I come from a middle class family, I am middle aged, single, no kids, no debt except my mortgage, always had low-average pay due to working in I.T. at colleges/universities my whole career. So never got above low 80s salary at my highest point. At 72k now. I currently am in a contract role for a state gov job that I've been promised will convert to regular employee at about 80k in a few months. The work is very easy. Nice coworkers. And since i'm in my 40s, I would still have the years left to take advantage of their pension in roughly 20 years. (I wont be eligible for it until conversion)

On a whim, I decided to apply to a role for a tech company that you all would know. I would categorize it as 1 step below FAANG.

I know thats probably still tiny to most of you, but this would be a different industry for me, so they r taking a risk on me in that respect. I know for sure this job would be more work and with a learning curve added on though, so I am kind of anxious about that.

Regardless of my final choice it sure did my ego good to get this offer though. It would be the most prestigious thing on my resume. I still can't believe they chose me lol. Oh, and they seemed nice too, but I know everyone puts their best foot forward in those scenarios. I am torn on what to do. What do you all think? Thank you so much.

Essentially I'm fairly new to my job, several months in, and I'm already looking for a new one because I think I'm facing an impossible battle. I won't win no matter what. 

My boss has made some uncomfortable comments to me.

The first one was when he insinuated I was going home with another coworker from a company event (random happy hour). I had asked the table if anyone wanted something else to drink and he asked if I was going home with other coworker. I was taken aback and repeated my original question. 

Later he also told me on a Zoom call that I was talking to that coworker for too long. 

On one client trip - the first one actually that I met him in person - he asked what my room number was. He left a little gift for me, which at the time I thought was odd but harmless. 

Then most recently, I sent him my most up to date work as there had been significant progress after long delay. I was so excited and felt really proud for the progress I made with the client. He then responded with heart-eye emojis and a gif of a cartoon character with a heart throbbing. His immediate response was something along the lines ""you are amazing"". 

I kind of brushed this off (aka ignored this) and gave instructions where it could be reviewed. He then said ""first I have to wash my hand before I look at it ;)"". 

Uh, pardon? 

Before you ask, there are multiple languages at play but this language we speak in (native to me) he is almost perfect and extremely articulate. I don't believe this is a typo or mistake. 

I don't know if he was drunk or what (I'm wondering due to the time this conversation happened). I of course screenshot the conversation for my records, but what can I do with this? 

This is a fairly large company we work for. I don't know how to even start a possible transfer to a new department or if that's even possible. 

Since I'm new to the company I don't really have any allies in upper management. Even people I'm supposed to work with don't even take me serious (this is a whole other story). I've been in this particular field for multiple years and it's kind of small world - I don't want to put a target on my back for future opportunities (e.g ""oh she's a troublemaker, at the last company she accused her manager of XYZ"") 

It can be so much worse -thank god I don't work in the same office as this guy - but we do have a client trip coming up and I'm dreading being around this dude. 

Any advice? Like I said I'm only a few months in so if I can find a new opportunity I can just erase this from my resume. 

The good news is I'm getting paid handsomely so I'm taking advantage of (and focusing on it with blinders on lol) until I can figure out a strategy. 

Can anyone help me figure out some options moving forward? Thank you. ",user_237,95,48

But to summarise here what [vestiaire.io](http://vestiaire.io) does:

* It figures out which colors suit you best and then shows you clothes, eyewear, and makeup that match, all from your favorite brands.

It’s awesome because it **only shows you stuff that will actually look good on you**, so no more wasting time scrolling through endless options.

""When I refer to myself as the [‘hot girl in your comp-sci class’](https://genius.com/21102578) (…) I was not, as many of you seem to think, referring to myself as hot because I think it’s an obvious fact, or because I’m vain. I was actually trying to reference the pressure that a lot of women feel in a male dominated profession or study, **to perform their femininity kind of to an extreme in attempt to not lose their gender identity** in the work that they’re doing. I also had in mind the ‘gamer girl’ aesthetic that a lot of us go through a kind of phase with, in an attempt to appeal not just to guys, but like, ‘techy guys’ specifically. So I was trying to refer to something a little bit deeper.”

Sadly, the video where the quote from have been deleted so I tried to make research on this subject but I haven't found anything.   
  
Because, as a women in a computer class, even tho I'm only a student for now, I was surprised to see how much I relate to this. I wasn't very feminine before taking interest into computer class, but when I started to take interest into this and made friends who are in computer class, I started to become extremely feminine without realizing or knowing why.   
  
It is only my experience, I didn't know it was an actual thing in fact, that is why I want to learn more about other women's experience on this subject. It will be also interesting to know if the stereotype of the ""gamer girl"" and all of this aesthetic had an influence on the way people started to treat you, and your opinion generally on this.",user_239,97,46

He intentionally misrepresents things I tell him, acts super negative, and then will backtrack in emails, saying only positive things.

At first I tried to be over accommodating to all of his high needs, but now I’m thinking it’s the wrong approach.

He talks up his experience constantly and talks down on every decision I make.

I've been in my career (biotech) for 12+ years and everything has been pretty OK until the last two years, when I entered management at a small company.

I am good at what I do. I had no formal manager training, so I enrolled in an online MBA. My company refused to reimburse because we are small and not a lot of funding, but I shrugged it off (it wasn't an expensive program). This week, I found out that a more junior male colleague enrolled in an in-person MBA program (more expensive than mine) and our company is helping pay for it.

Earlier this month, I asked about attending a specific scientific conference later this year, and my manager asked me to put the information together on it and other potential conferences. He called me this week to say that I couldnt go to the scientific conference because of the travel costs / funding, but he'd be ok with me attending the local operations conference (but couldn't confirm that they would reimburse the registration fee yet). Yesterday, I found out that our manager offered the scientific conference attendance to a male colleague (when he was complaining to me about how much he hates to travel). My boss used all the information I had provided him to make the case to his management on funding it.

There have been so many little things too, like being talked over in meetings, having my technical expertise be mansplained to me, credit taken for my work. I try to calmly call out those little things in the moment, but what do I even do now? Would it make any difference saying anything to my boss at this point? 

I am starting to think I might have to find another job, but I built a department here and because of funding havent been able to hire as much as I would like. Leaving will put a number of projects in jeopardy, and add a lot of stress on people who don't deserve it either.",user_231,93,33

Layoffs sucks, nothing new here. If you're facing a layoff here are ways to make it less painful.

**Before layoff:** 

* write down your projects, save important documents, send yourself any docs/metrics
* go to the doctor, dentist, optometrist etc. Stock up any medication you need
* potentially adjust 401k contributions if you need to be cash heavy in the future.
* if you are impacted the next important thing is planning your financial runway and budget. Apply for unemployment insurance.

**During layoff:**

* Give yourself a break. Like seriously. Take a walk. Give yourself a weekend or week to feel, rest, and not react. Layoffs are a money & business decision 90% of time

**After layoff:**

* Get your finances in order: Understand your severance, apply for unemployment, and budget your financial runway immediately (including cutting down on expenses).
* Create a job search plan. We've seen how many posts that show how tough it is to get hired. It's not enough to apply & wait. Edit your resume, share it with friends for review or work with a professional. Leverage your network and let them know you're looking for work & reach out to companies.
* Give yourself frequent breaks after layoff and during your job search to avoid burnout.

And I felt like I could get help any time I have doubts. 

On my current team, my manager and the team lead are great. They tell me I should start thinking about a promotion, and tell me I deserve it even though I’m terrified to be promoted or even think about it! 

Most of the amazing mentors and people who believed in me, who treated me equally have been men who have daughters at home. They’re progressive and recognize that they’re paving the way for their daughters’ future. Others were educated intelligent well-raised successful people.

I'm trying to make it in a different field, but sometimes I miss the pure joy of coding. But not the drama.

It was a nightmarish 3 years at a unicorn tech company...can't put it otherwise. I still process over the trauma it gave me. I still wonder what I could have done differently, how much of it was really my fault. Maybe I really wasn't a good Software Engineer, and maybe I was really a good-for-nothing crybaby, as they seemed to view me, and deserved all the shit I got. But I can't help feel I was some sort of ""scapegoat"" of the company, at least the team.

For background, I am an Asian female. I have a BS and an MS in CS from one of HYPSM (this was my first job out of school). But your degree and your ability isn't really that related. I was never really a programming kid growing up, and I kinda went with the flow to choose CS as a major because ""everyone is doing CS"" (and other practical reasons). That's my fault. Maybe this was the price I had to pay.

I admit I didn't feel 100% capable and skilled at any time during my job. Sometimes I dealt with a lot of brain fog. **When your HR isn't helping you, and your manager had the audacity to put you on the same project as the person you reported, how much can you focus on learning the codebase?**

Even though I wanted to train myself, be better, having all the emotional baggage really drained me down. **I learned it's colossally difficult to learn and improve when you are, well at least you believe you are, not treated like an equal human being by those around you.** It was also during the pandemic.

There are too many instances to count. Too many slights, snubs, mansplaining, etc. to go through. But here are just some key dramas that happened:

[1.At](http://1.At) my first team, the manger was a fellow Asian female. Everyone else were dudes. They barely talked about my ""new grad project"" which ""didn't have a deadline."" I was invisible at meetings, so was my project. However, suddenly, they realized my project had a deadline. I found that out, like 1.5 weeks before the deadline. Apparently when my manager said it ""didn't have a deadline,"" she meant ""If it's done before the deadline, it ships. If not, then it doesn't ship. Like ever."" But the PM (and the Marketing Team) wasn't on roll with that. **This had to ship.** So I suddenly worked lots of over-hours and worked with the manger to cut down on many spots to make the deadline.

But the manager took no responsibility of the havoc it caused, and I got zero credit for pulling this through (because ""you got help from so many people"" - really? looking back, that looks like a fairly normal amount of collaboration between people who work on the same, uh, *company.* And I really wrote all the code...). And also, why would anyone want to work on something for months, knowing it will never ship??? If she thought that was really ok, why didn't she tell that to me sooner???

2. There was an older white dude that kept making icky comments. He would ""compliment"" my outfit, would ask me to rate the attractiveness of a celebrity, and so on. This caused me a lot of confusion and I couldn't focus on my work (to be fair, these comments were fairly benign compared to the totality of yuck within tech, but as I said, I was a fresh grad so had no immunity to these stuff).

**Then one day, when I asked him where he was going to sit, he said ""on your lap.""**

I was shocked. I couldn't focus on anything. I mean now, as I am four years older and four years more jaded, I *think* I can brush it off. But back then, not at all. This was the company that said they care ***so*** much about women and underrepresented minorities. I can't give you too many details, but this company really espouses the point that they are ""different from other tech companies"" and ""everyone is welcomed and respected."" **They have a really good brand (looking back, it was a borderline cult).**

After a lot of thinking (and searching up similar stories on Reddit), I reported this to my manager. The same manager from #1. Her knee-jerk response?

**""He says that to guys too,"" with a smile, as if I am bringing up the stupidest thing ever.**

Looking back, she was a borderline psychopath. Not just because of this, but everything that happened during our relationship.

Anyhow, she reported this to HR, because she knew it would look bad on her if she didn't. Now, the HR lady was that typical white HR lady that says she will help you but secretly wants to destroy your soul.

They - the manager, HR lady, many other people I talked to - let me talk about all the difficulties of being a woman in tech. They let me talk about all the instances I felt snubbed for being a woman, not just this on-your-lap dude. They were like “Yeah, bring it all up!"" “Call it all out!"" “We want to hear from you!"" “Our company is different from other companies!!!"" Looking back, I shouldn't have. I should have just kept to the point about the dude. I was really just playing the woman card. **I wish I knew they were making me talk not to help me, but to collect ammunition to paint me as the good-for-nothing crybaby they had to make me be.**

How do I know this? Well, for one - HR never got back to me. I never found out what happened with the on-your-lap guy. When I asked them, like after a year, they said it's ""confidential.""

And my manager? Well....she said she thinks I have ""low tolerance to stress."" And she also said that ""when you are more senior, you'll realize how wrong you were."" (I can't remember the exact wording, but it was basically the same effect, revealing that she never listened to me in the first place.)

**And then she put me on the same project as the on-your-lap guy, and we had to work together one-on-one for weeks.** Back then, I didn't realize it, but now, it chills me to the bone how much she didn't care.

There are many other instances where this manager gaslighted and snubbed me, even in more professional context, but I have to give too much context. Looking back, she really couldn't stand me. I was this weird thing that came in to her perfect team and was starting to ruin it. She and the on-your-lap guy had worked well together for years - she wasn't going to jeopardize that relationship because of this good-for-nothing-entitled-crybaby-girl. And the HR?? Well, I think they loved the drama. I was just a drama source. Not a human being.

3. After all that happened (+much more), you wouldn't be surprised that I just didn't want to befriend anyone in the company anymore. I just kept to myself, didn't socialize, just did my work. **But here's my sin - I wanted to be acknowledged for my work.** That was my fault. I should have just accepted my role as the quiet, obedient coding monkey, who has no emotion, and who occasionally provides drama for the fun of everyone -- **I shouldn't have dared to think I can be recognized as a competent laborer!! But I wanted to.**

And maybe now, and better as I get older, I can practice the elusive art of getting your work done while being undisturbed by all human bullshit surrounding me, but I wasn't able to do that back then. Also the angst from all previous drama hadn't been resolved. I became ""sharp, aggressive, hard to work with"" -- all the classic things women in tech are called. I became snappy when men started being mansplainy (maybe now, I have the wisdom to just smile and let them mansplain while I mentally plan my dinner). I became angry when too many meetings and interviews got scheduled, leaving me scarce time for actual work (maybe now, I have the stamina to wake up at 5am, get work done ""before work,"" and let them waste my ""working hours"").

This continued until this young white male joined the team. He was new to the company, but he was about a year or two more senior than me. He talked a lot. He would talk about 90% of the meeting. And meetings would go over 1-2 hours. He had no respect for meeting members' time. If he wanted to talk, we were to be his audience. This irked me (maybe now, I have the inner balance to just politely and calmly excuse myself from the meeting with a plausible excuse).

And then he joined this project me and another colleague had been working on for months before he joined. We would have meetings where he would just talk and talk, and the 30-minute meeting was going on its two-hour mark. And he didn't seem to care. *And he was talking nonsense*.

One key nonsense was that he was suggesting we import certain third-party data into a ""big, giant table."" I said that wouldn't be feasible as the third-party data is ***nested***. He asked me to explain. I did. But he wouldn't get it. Actually, he wasn't even listening to me. He seemed hurt that I shot down his idea (and pooped his party) and didn't want to admit he could be wrong. He kept looking for ways where nested data can be indeed imported into a ""big, giant table."" (A week later, he saw my point.) They all made no sense. I got very irritated. And became...ah, ***aggressive***.

For the next hour or so, I was very snappy. And shot down all his ideas. He got very hurt. And we ended the meeting. Looking back, I should have just zoned out and watched cat videos while he was performing his standup comedy. And then get real work done with the other colleague while barely including him. All the while giving him the ego validation - the only thing he wanted. But I lacked the flexibility to act smart like that.

After the meeting, I felt a bit bad for being so snappy. And I found out he was indeed right for one point he said. He said our X service has Y but I said it doesn't, because it is barely used and I didn't encounter its existence for the 2+ years I was in that company. But it really did have Y (there's little likelihood he actually knew that, he was just spewing whatever came to his mind and got luckily right) so I apologized to him on that point over Slack. Later, my such ""apology"" would become proof that I was 100% culpable during that meeting. (I realize this is why my manger from Story 1 never apologized. She knew it could be used against her.)

The week of the meeting, and the week after, this kid (I don't know what else to call him) scheduled meetings with me to ""talk about *that meeting*."" And we were on Zoom...and I didn't know what to do?? I asked him, ""Do you want me to apologize?"" He said no. ""Should I be nicer during meetings?"" He said that wasn't it. ""THEN WHAT???"" He didn't say anything. But looked at me like I was some sort of psychopathic monster. And these meetings, again, went overtime by a lot. **I was, in my working hours, sitting on a one-on-one Zoom, expected to pet and stroke this pouting kid's ego. (THEY never petted MY ego. WHY SHOULD I PET HIS??????)**

And that didn't end there. Our co-manager (different from Story 1, 2 manager - this one is white male) had multiple 1-on-1s with me (at least three or four) where we talked about ""my behavior during that meeting."" I asked him the same questions ""WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO???? OR SAY????"" (I didn't scream this, but I wanted to.) He said ""I don't know."" But he just sat there, expecting me to say *something*. Here I was, spending three or four meetings with my manager, talking about ""my behavior,"" given no actionable feedback, but not even allowed to move on to talk about actual work. It was just torture. **What did they want me to do? Kneel down and repent??**

It didn't end there. The kid gave me detailed peer feedback, basically word salad, where he used all my words against me and painted me as some psychopathic monster. This was going to go on my HR file forever since it was official feedback. He said we were in a ""divergent phase in brainstorming"" so it wasn't appropriate for me to shoot down his ideas like that, which should have been done in a more ""convergent phase."" WTF????? Never heard those words before. *And again, we had already been working on this project for months before he joined.*

The same company that basically told me to eat it up when I was getting snubbed (Story 1 & 2), was basically telling me to stroke the ego of this kid. Because what? Because he's a white male??? And I'm an Asian female???

**What they wanted to say, was already indirectly saying, was this: “Shut up and eat up all the bullshit we give you.“** Bullshit including bullshit management, bullshit meetings, bullshit brand. But they didn't want to say it, because it goes against their brand. But they still wanted me to get the message and act accordingly. But they didn't want to be the one who says it.

I wish they just said this. Then my three years would have been lot less confused and dramatic. And they wouldn’t have had the grumpy colleague I was. But I guess if they were that transparent, I wouldn’t have joined them in the first place.

This is a brick wall of a post. It got longer than I initially thought. Thanks to anyone that read this far. This still doesn't contain all of the drama I experienced -- maybe about 20%? But this gives you the idea. Basically, I didn't feel like an equal human being. I felt like a scapegoat of sorts, getting hazed for having a backbone. Looking back, I am thankful that I didn't actually go crazy. I mean, they were already treating me like a crazy person.

I love development. It took me very long to get there. Whenever I tried to, I was told that women and tech don’t belong together. But when COVID hit the world, I got my chance and grabbed it. I graduated as a very good student from my trainings, got my first jobs. I lost my first job because I didn’t accept that I as a woman had to shut up. My later work experiences were better, but I lost my last a long time ago. Since then, I had a lot of job interviews and trainings. In all of my trainings, I was the best of my classes even with experienced fellow students. But in my job applications I was told that (career changing) women are not wanted (career changing men were accepted).
Now, I will have my very first technical interview, but after all this time, some more or less blunt insults, I am insecure if I can make it. Not because of my technical knowledge, but because my nerves are wrecked. 

I ask myself if I should change my profession. But if I would change my profession… to what? You need money to eat, but physically, I am very limited. I can only do computer work or work I could do at home like arts or sewing. I don’t believe I will be able to buy food with this. Should I release my own apps?

I think obviously yeah it is internalized misogyny, but the more detailed reasoning is how women are depicted in fiction. 

We can start off using the famous Bechdel test which is well known for movies to fail. For the uninitiated, the test is simply are there two named women who talk to each other and is their subject not about a man. Now this may be a stretch, but I think the reason why there is the particular extra condition is because often if there are two named women, then typically they only talk about the male lead because they are the two love interests, existing solely to fight each other over him to elevate his status. Which brings me to the main reason why I believe women feel threatened by other women especially when there are only two of them: in fiction, women often fight other women, especially in male dominated stories. 

Of course, the reason why women are portrayed this way ties back to misogyny. It’s because if a woman’s rival is a man, it implies that they are on par with each other, equals. This is “lowering” the man. Even if there is a competent woman in a show or movie, they must have some female rival. It’s to delegate women as always second class, no matter what. And then the reason why the woman is competent at all is to simply be more attractive to the male lead. 

So in short, the main reason is that in fiction, there is a scarcity of women and if there do exist multiple women, their sole purpose is to fight each other. This is what causes the internalized misogyny which makes women feel threatened by each other on the team. They may feel there can only be one woman who can come out on top as society has told us there is only room for one woman to be successful.",user_260,79,39

I love this sub and the sense of community it fosters. It’s clear that many of us are navigating tough times, and I wanted to take a moment to reflect on some common themes I’ve seen shared here:

1. The pain of layoffs and the uncertainty of job searches that seem to stretch endlessly.
2. The frustration and hurt caused by gender-based mistreatment and discrimination.
3. The overwhelming feelings of burnout or being lost in our current roles, unsure of where to go next.

First, I want to acknowledge how valid and heavy these experiences are. It takes courage to show up, share, and keep moving forward despite it all. If you’re reading this and feeling the weight of any of these struggles, please know that you’re not alone—and more importantly, this won’t last forever.

To everyone navigating the aftermath of layoffs or job rejections: remember that the right opportunity often takes time to appear, and it’s okay to take small steps each day. Use this time to reconnect with your strengths, revisit your resume (with input from trusted peers), or learn something new—however small. Every little bit counts, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now.

To those dealing with discrimination or mistreatment: you deserve respect, equality, and dignity in every space you occupy. If you can, lean on supportive allies, document instances of unfair treatment, and seek mentors who can help advocate for you. Your value isn’t diminished by others’ biases. You belong here.

And to those who feel burnout creeping in or are unsure of your next move: it’s okay to pause. Sometimes, stepping back and giving yourself permission to rest, reflect, or simply exist without constant striving can bring clarity. You don’t have to have it all figured out today—or tomorrow. Be kind to yourself; your next step will reveal itself in time.

**A few practical tips to lift your mood in the meantime:**

* **Set small, achievable goals:** Whether it’s updating one section of your LinkedIn profile, applying to just one job, or even getting outside for a short walk, small wins add up.
* **Celebrate progress, not just outcomes:** Did you revise your resume? Network with a new contact? That’s progress! Give yourself credit for the effort you’re putting in.
* **Lean on your community:** Don’t hesitate to reach out here, to friends, or to mentors. Sometimes, just sharing your thoughts or hearing someone else’s story can remind you of your own resilience.
* **Find joy in the little things:** A cozy cup of tea, a favorite song, or a quiet moment to yourself can be grounding when the big picture feels overwhelming.

You’re stronger than you think, and you’ve already come so far. Sending each of you encouragement, strength, and the reminder that brighter days are ahead. Keep going—you’re capable of incredible things, even when it doesn’t feel that way.

Love and solidarity,

One-of-us",user_41,77,3

I have all the mental load of thinking about the bigger picture and what needs to be done, with none of the respect that type of burden deserves. Maybe that doesn’t deserve respect?

I’m really hoping to get some advice or just vent because I’m at my breaking point with a situation at work. I’ve been coding for a while now, and I’m really proud of the work I do. I follow best practices, ensure things are working well, and make sure the client is always happy. But there’s this one colleague who constantly forces me to code in *his* way, even when my solution is already working perfectly.

Even when my code meets the requirements and the client has no complaints, he won’t let me move forward until I rewrite it to fit his specific style or logic. There’s never any technical reason for it — he just wants it done his way, which often isn’t even more efficient. And when I ask for reasoning, I just get vague responses like ""it’s cleaner"" or ""this is how I prefer it,"" with no real explanation.

What makes this even more frustrating is that I’m a woman in STEM, and it’s already hard enough to be taken seriously. Every hit feels twice as hard because people already assume I’m going to be bad at it anyway. He constantly tries to assert dominance, and even though I’ve always treated him respectfully, at this point, it feels like he’s using me as a doormat to boost his own ego. I’m starting to feel like my contributions don’t matter at all.

The worst part? He does this in such a subtle way that even if I took it to HR, I wouldn’t have rock-solid proof of his mistreatment. It’s always just enough to chip away at my confidence without crossing any clear lines. It’s like I’m constantly second-guessed, but in ways that feel impossible to directly challenge without being accused of overreacting.

Has anyone dealt with something like this? How do you handle it when someone is constantly undermining your work and trying to assert control without any clear reason? How do you stand up for yourself when the behavior is so subtle that it’s hard to prove?

I’m just so tired of being treated this way and constantly having my work questioned for no reason. Any advice or shared experiences would really mean a lot to me.

They gave generic advice like creating a to-do list and one thing at a time, etc. Additionally, made a comment about going elsewhere if I didn’t like that. I definitely felt frustrated with that response as they know I will be going on leave soon.

Worker protections in the US are garbage. Going through the process of suing employers related to discrimination is tedious and challenging. It's SO EASY for companies to target women, non-white people, queer people, neurodivergent people, and disabled people for termination and make it about some other issue. This helps to make it even more difficult to have recourse like successfully suing for discrimination. Some of you are already dealing with this on a day to day basis. The manifestation of this is supervisors who suddenly have problems with your performance after you've brought a hostile workplace situation to their attention. The boss who says that there's a culture fit problem before terminating you because you found out you were being underpaid for the same work as a coworker and asked for a salary adjustment. The team lead who backs up a team member who tells you to calm down after you ask a neutral question.

How do you make it harder for them? Remember the below. And others please feel free to share your own tips.

* Work is not ""family"", they're your employer and they hold the position of power in the dynamic ALWAYS.
* Work friends are not real life friends, they're acquaintances. Work friends will jeopardize your career/health/sanity to save their own. Be friendly, get coffee with people, but keep your guard up. This includes supervisors.
* HR works for the company/organization, not for you. They are there to minimize the company's risk, not act in your interests.
* If you are experiencing discrimination, your best friend is documentation. Screenshots, forwarded emails, logs of certain behaviors. All of this needs to be kept on a device or cloud service not owned or provided by the organization.
* Many/most employment lawyers work on contingency, they get paid when you get paid. If you are experiencing discrimination and feel like you are being pushed out and think you can't afford representation, you CAN find a lawyer who will represent you based on contingency.
* Tech workers can unionize, we can try to level the playing field with these companies. Unionizing isn't without risk, but formally organizing can trigger protections against retaliation and the appearance of retaliation. And honestly, isn't it better to try and get back some of your power from these chumps instead of just doing the capitalism death march while they use and abuse you.

Good luck out there.",user_274,72,3

I never have.

Women are more apt to explain their background and level of knowledge on a topic. But there's a model of arrogant guy who shows up at a meeting with nothing to contribute, and announces: ""I know just enough to be dangerous"" without articulating what he does actually know about the topic, and what he needs to learn. This type of guy doesn't want to admit that he needs things explained to him (by a woman!) or that he knows less than you do on the topic. So he couches his ignorance in an idiom that makes him feel powerful and *dangerous*.

Has anybody else noticed this behavioral tic? And have you ever responded in a way that doesn't placate and coddle the self-described 'dangerous man'? These guys are relying on us to soothe them, and proactively explain things to then to bring them up to speed without them having to admit that they don't know what's going on. I'm tempted to respond straight-faced with, 'And what would ""dangerous"" mean in this context?' or 'Well that sounds interesting. What is it that you know that makes you so dangerous?'

Is anybody else as tired of this catchphrase and having to humor the guys who say it as I am?

  
ETA: For added context, I work in software and meetings always start with introductions of your name and what team you work on. Nobody is even being asked, 'What do you know?' Guys just feel compelled to announce how dangerous they are at random.",user_275,74,53

So today I went to her desk and casually asked her what she has been working on - turns out she was stuck on something pretty basic. She hangs out and works together with other male junior developers (who are a couple of years more experienced than her) and I’m surprised how they didn’t help her almost to the point that it seems they did it on purpose (just a hunch, I’m not sure if that’s the case but seemed weird that they didn’t help her). Like some comments suggested, she did get a little defensive and wanted to prove that she knows what she’s talking about more than I do but I tried to be gentle yet assertive (won’t let her or anyone disrespect me tbh) and guide her in what she’s doing. 

Throughout the day I checked on her a couple of times as well and she seemed to be stuck on small things which again I nudged her in the right direction. She was able to complete the task today and I’m glad she did because it seemed like she would’ve taken another 3-4 days at the very least if I didn’t intervene.

Some of the other senior engineers are noticing that she has been taking much more time (tbh she took around 4-5 times the amount of time than it was estimated to be) than expected so I think they might call it out but at least it’s done. 

I think she already realises that she has been lagging behind - if I do talk to her directly, it could be a slap on her confidence. I’m thinking to just informally keep nudging her until she asks me upfront.

The s***** job I had at the time to take that interview.. I was so excited back then. Because I thought I was gonna be getting an offer. I thought I was finally gonna get out of this. But then I email the recruiter and ask what's happening? And she says that they can't justify the hire so I had gotten put on the talent pipeline.

There's even another instance where I had an interview with a recruiter, then I did an assessment which I had to study for 3 weeks for because it was in the language that I was new at and that topic that I was new at I passed that I had 3 interviews in 1 week and that next. Monday, I got a rejection.

I am exhausted. I am tired of receiving no's when I know for a d*** fact I could do the job. Feel like that mouse and that sick experiment. That just keeps getting shocked over and over and over again. There seems like there's no escape.

It feels impossible to get anywhere right now. It feels like no matter how hard I try. I'm just gonna end up disappointed. I can't see a way out of it. I can't see a white light at the end of the tunnel. I want to see it so bad, but I just can't right now.

I am terrified every day and I'm running out of money. I am terrified of what's gonna happen to me? I have no family to fall back on. I have nothing I'm terrified.

I am working my a** off to develop new skills to build projects to even contribute open source projects. But lately, it's just even been hard to get myself out of bed because of how bad my situation is. I want to believe it's gonna get better, but I just can't see it.

I am at 4 rejections just today.

Directors and VPs who seem completely out of touch with reality, yet are driving decisions.

People who blatantly don’t do their jobs or seem to do the bare minimum with no accountability.

Some people working non-stop on the wrong things, creating weird team expectations instead of collaboration.

What are your survival tips? How do you stay motivated when the leadership feels incompetent, and accountability is nonexistent? How do you ensure your work is seen and valued in this kind of environment, especially when it feels like you’re constantly picking up the pieces of other people’s lack of attention. ",user_288,67,16

For some background, I have a bachelor of science and have been working in healthcare for about 6 years (direct patient care in hospitals, dialysis, etc). I became interested in learning more about coding when I realized that  coders/software engineers are an integral part of the process when it comes to designing medical charting systems like EPIC that are used in major hospitals. I’m very intrigued as this career change would allow me to still be involved in healthcare, but would give me the flexibility and hopefully room for growth in the field that I don’t have with my current career. I have only very minimal coding experience from the days of MySpace, but after watching some tutorials/learning more about it, it does seem like something I would enjoy doing!

So…are coding bootcamps worth it? I’m not interested in going back to school to obtain an official degree in computer science. I know a few people personally that have done a coding bootcamp and have had success following their completion, however, they completed their bootcamps between 2018-2021, so I’m not sure their experiences are up to date. 

Any advice for transitioning from healthcare to tech? Thank you in advance! :)",user_289,66,67

If all goes well (fingers crossed), I’ll have a successful freelancing situation for the remainder of the year and onward.

I setup an LLC under which I’ll operate. And I’ve got 3 contracts signed for development work.

I’ve always hated working for other people. And I mean who are we kidding… work is a four letter word for a reason. It sucks. But being able to freelance has been my dream since I transitioned into tech because I’m so anti-authority. I’ve always wanted to work my own hours, at my own speed, prioritizing tasks as I see fit. I have not enjoyed working on fundamentally irrelevant tasks that some incompetent, non-technical leader has deemed necessary to achieve some such objective to boost the bottom line.

Being a woman in tech ain’t always easy. Especially without the camaraderie of other ladies going through it with you. And I have a military background, so I’ve had my fair share of working predominantly with men in the workplace for nearly a decade. I’m tired of the ego being interwoven into workplace discussions, even “friendly” ones. Tired of being seen as too aggressive or too direct (I’m not. K?! Deal with it!). Tired of working the day away to fulfill someone else’s dream and being under appreciated and under paid.

Now, I get to set the terms of my work myself. I can choose the type of work I take on, who I’d like to work with, how much to charge. And if I’m unhappy with the work or the client or the pay, I can terminate the arrangement and still have other avenues for income.

I know being a freelancer / business owner is a lot of hard work. But I’d rather break my back figuring things out for my own business. Not someone else’s.

I’m not leaving the industry behind. Just forging a new path for myself so that I might be able to maintain my passion for the art of development.

And this is just the beginning.

I probably need to go out and get myself one of those “World’s Best Boss” mugs cuz even though I’m managing a department of one right now, as Kelly Kapoor says, I am not easy to manage.

I can’t believe I get to say it… I’m a business owner! With clients! Real, living, breathing clients!

I have been applying for jobs and getting nothing. I have had recruiters find me and have had referrals and nothing. 

I even got desperate and signed up to fiverr to try and freelance and I have been on there for 8 months with zero hits. Apparently you need sales skills and marketing skills to do that. Two things I got into programming because I wanted to avoid having to do those things. I have no skills in either one of those. I typically will nope the heck out of a job if I have to go up to people and try to sell them something.

I couldn't even sell girl scout cookies growing up. I don't have a large enough social media following to do anything with that. Also wouldn't that be bad form to advertise freelancing on LinkedIn especially if I am still trying for a full time job?

I feel like I am just being forced out and I don't know how to stay in. 

I did try open source for the first time but I had a nightmare time with the licensing as the documentation was not up to date. So I will probably need to try a different repo for that ( also it doesn't pay and I need money).

Someone (50s? M) added me on LinkedIn a couple of weeks ago. He said he could help me and create a job for me. Since a lot of junior dev jobs are hard to come by right now in this job market and then they do, seniors tend to get those jobs.

Snapchat is in no way professional. It is not a relevant way to contact someone professionally. Plus the disappearing messages? Am I overreacting for wanting to ghost him after that?

Over the last few weeks, he’s made some odd passing remarks (mentioning an ex, teasing me) and he tends to come to the area I am working in. He is really helpful and approves my PRs a lot of the time so I didn’t think much of it again. 

Today, he hovered especially a lot around me. It was kind of annoying because I was trying to work, but I brushed it off. Then at the end of the day, he asked if I wanted to hang out over the weekend. I really hope I’m overthinking this all and that he’s just a friendly guy, but I’m also feeling a little uncomfortable now because I’m thinking that it might be more. I’m naturally a really friendly person which I kind of regret now, because idk if that led him on. I said no to hanging out with some poorly thought of excuse and left office.

Also, I’ve mentioned my boyfriend in passing a few times to some other coworkers but I actually don’t know if he was listening. 

Just wanted to vent a bit because if he was showing interest, it’s really frustrating to me. I plan on bringing up my boyfriend (for like the third time lol) and make sure he hears this time.

I've been at my new job a month and I was at my previous job for 7 years. I was a senior reverse engineer. I loved the work and the people, but I was pretty underpaid. I was also extremely comfortable, knew my job, didn't have to learn anything new, so I was kind of wanting to do something different. I recently got a job as a cyber reverse engineer for a government contractor and I'm already pretty unhappy.  

There was no formal onboarding or anything, just ""hey, this is the project you're working on, this is an (outdated) wiki to get your computer/build system setup."" Which is fine, but then my ""mentor"" would come by and check on me, and he sort of got irritated I was doing some of the outdated stuff. (I didn't know it was outdated.) The code base is also super complex and different from what I used too, and I feel like I'm taking too long to get up to speed. My mentor told me to ""read code for a day or two"" to get everything figured out. and I mean I figured out a little but its a huge codebase, and there is a lot of abstraction going on so I still don't have a full understanding of everything. 

I was also yelled at by the same guy in my second week. I was kind of using a different file to base some of my work off because it was similar but my mentor did NOT like that. He raised his voice in the middle of the office like ""Why are you using that??? You shouldn't be using that at all!"". He sat down with me and it turned out I did need to use it, and he apologized. But I was extremely embarrassed and trying not to cry. Like i'm 30 years old and just got scolded in front of everyone. 

another time I was trying to solve this problem and i was like hey, i dont know the full scope of everything yet and what all this code touches, so i think i could fix the problem by doing either option A (explained option) or option B (explained option) and he was like ""..... why is option B even an option thats such a bad idea bc this code gets exported to blah blah and you should have never considered that"" and ugh, I was WFH that day and I just started crying.

Since the pandemic normalized remote work i've noticed that the ability to self promote oneself has been supercharged and now it seems that you are disadvantaged if you dont play this game. The people who are promoted always seem to be in group Slack chats posting several times each day.

This issue seems much worse in tech than other industries probably because everyone is in front of a computer and Linkedin, social media etc. in which everyone seems to be bragging about something in the strangest of ways. If you are in manual work, healthcare worker etc. then its not likely you are posting on Linkedin about how you saved x amount of lives today. It now also seems to be needed to get hired since a recruiter/hiring manager will think its strange if you dont have a monolog of posts.

I wondered if anyone else feels this way and if so how they have managed this. I'm personally considering leaving tech because I dont think I can change my personality enough to partake in the constant self promotion needed.",user_302,60,20

After 18 months of unemployment, I took a very basic blue-collar job in a front-facing customer service position. And … I’m actually happy somehow? Low stress, no work outside of work hours, a  non-toxic work environment, and a pretty decent boss who is also an old acquaintance are all positives. But my ego is struggling with going from a prestigious career to being the front counter person at a large production facility mainly dealing with B2B customers. 

**Has anyone else made an involuntary career downshift and found the change to be a positive one in the long run?**

—

I’ve [mentioned on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/s/jzvIgIJ0p7) ([Multiple](https://www.reddit.com/r/Layoffs/s/kjXUe3BtfO). [Times](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/s/lPX0qcaWFM).) how I was unceremoniously let go from my dream job through no fault of my own, and also [shared my struggles](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/s/jcbc377Ncv) with figuring out what to do going forward.  My skills set was broad enough to hop industries, but working in my specific industry niche (working in leadership for a specific religious denomination) was no longer an option due to the politics of the org. I stagnated for a year and a half trying to figure out what to do with my life. I had slowly watched the opportunities that fit my skills set on Indeed and other sites slowly dwindle down in number and salary range the longer my unemployment lasted, and while I was able to land multiple interviews, for the first time in my career I struggled to land the job. 

I was offered a position by a friend at an ex-employer, a place where I had worked during a “transitional” phase in my career for a brief stint. The position I had held way back in 2008 was a white-collar corporate level position, but this new position was very much a front-facing, customer service retail role. (Think working at The Container Store corporate offices in the Procurement office, then switching to working at a store as the Elfa consultant.) 

I was hesitant to take the position because other than the fact that I knew my future boss and knew we would get along great, and the fact that any income at all would keep us from getting any further in debt, there is not a lot of positives to taking the job. The company started out as a mom-and-pop small service and production shop and has slowly grown by acquisition of other small mom-and-pop competitors. But in many crucial ways, the corporate processes are still run like a mom-and-pop, and are literally decades behind what is possible for the industry. It also has abysmal benefits, the commute is one of the worst I’ve had in my career, there is virtually no opportunity for advancement, and the base pay is 33% lower than my last job. And on top of all of that, this position is at its core an entry level blue-collar retail job. After graduating college with a Bachelor’s degree, working for 20 years as an admin assistant with reporting and analysis skills and over 10 years as a web developer and social media expert, this position has me punching a time clock and asking people, “What type of credit card will you be using to pay for your purchase today?”

But we need the money, and while the money isn’t great it’s enough to be worth my time, so I begrudgingly accepted the job. 

Here’s the twist, though … I actually kind of really like the job. As long as I get there on time to open the doors for the business at 8a, do all of the different tasks that come my way during the day, and do the end of the day reports, everyone is happy. While there are few career paths with advancement within the company, they do value experience, longevity and industry knowledge. I have multiple co-workers who have been with the company 25+ years, including my boss and my boss’s boss. It’s the least political and least toxic workplace I’ve worked at in my career, and that includes when I worked before in the Corporate offices of the same company. I feel like an important and critical part of the team. I have a short list of main responsibilities (customer support,  billing/CC payment processing, delivery scheduling, and a few other smaller tasks as needed), and a majority of my tasks take 5-10 minutes max to complete. I can quickly complete a task, put the paperwork in the Done pile and actually be done with it. Virtually all of the customers are older workers who have been in the industry for decades and are jovial and patient with me when it takes a bit to get them what they need. And when the rare customer is cranky (always an individual with a personal project rather than a B2B customer), my manager has my back 100%. 

As long as I do the things required of me in a timely manner and ask my boss or someone else for a little help when I need it, I can make small process improvements without being rewarded for my hard work with more work. There’s also no pressure to “make positive changes” simply for the sake of change, which is almost always a control move by a person in power to look innovative without actually innovating. (Or without actually doing any work themselves. But I digress.) I have a ton of autonomy to do the work that comes in at the pace and priority that works best for me, and it never gets so out of hand that I can’t eventually catch up with it at the end of the day. 

I do have to punch in and out, but now I get overtime and all the OT should add close to $500+ a paycheck - almost $10K a year - to my income.  Just getting in 5-10 minutes early, eating my lunch at my computer instead of taking an actual lunch, and staying only 30 minutes after closing for the reports, my OT hours end up being over 8 hours a week at time and a half pay. And I definitely worked that kind of schedule almost every day at my old job. I haven’t been hourly in decades, but I had forgotten how much being paid for working overtime, as opposed to being a “team player” and working excessive hours without compensation or appreciation, really helps with making me feel quantifiably valuable. 

Most importantly, the stress simply isn’t there like my last job. I don’t have my work email on my personal phone and when I punch out I don’t have to worry about work again until the next time I punch in. It’s literally impossible for me to work from home due to the nature of my job, which means no frantic calls on weekends or holiday breaks to work on this urgent thing that just came up. (Or send out that Thanksgiving message that didn’t get OK’ed to send until 10p on Wed night. Yes, that happened at my last job. Multiple times. And on more than just the Thanksgiving holiday.) I’m working the same hours that I used to but now I’m getting paid for all of the extra hours.

This job is also much better for my physical health than my old job. In my last years at my old job I had two cancer scares with two separate surgeries to remove pre-cancerous cells (get your yearly Well-Woman exams, ladies!), as well as an emergency gallbladder removal surgery and a case of shingles - all before I was 50. I’m required to stand or move for around 50-60% of my day, and I’ve noticed after a month that my physical health and endurance has already made significant positive improvements. I was so burned out and physically ill from the stress of my last job that I wasn’t capable of even looking for a new job until I had spent six months recovering and healing from the damage done. My daily steps have gone from under 2k a day at my old job to less than 1k during my unemployment to over 7k a work day now. While my feet are achy at the end of the day, I am amazed at how much easier a short walk in the grocery store is these days. 

The job is even better for my marriage than my old job. While I am a faithful member of the denomination where I used to work, my husband has never been religious. So much of my life revolved around my job and my faith (including extensive volunteer work at my church), both of which were foreign worlds to my husband.  He worked at a different location of the business where I work now for over a dozen years, but he was in production rather than customer service. Between my new job and his current job in the same industry, he and I now have a ton to talk about at night when we get home from work. 

So here I am, in the most entry level position I’ve been in since my nights and weekends second job in my mid 20’s. And to my shock and surprise, I’m actually at peace. Content. Less stress than I’ve had in a decade at least. While I accepted the job with the attitude that this is obviously a temporary placeholder until I get a “real” job, there’s a growing part of me that wouldn’t mind staying here for a while. 

But I’m suffering a bit from the cognitive dissonance of it all. Should I be this content with such a “basic” job that uses neither my skills nor my education, but grants me freedom from a level of stress that was literally killing me? 

I’m also having a hard time accepting the fact that this job is a salary hit for me from my old job. For most of my marriage I worked white-collar jobs and was either the primary breadwinner of the family or at least made considerably more than my husband, who has worked blue-collar production roles in the same industry since we got married. It feels odd for him to now be making more than me, although with my income with OT and his income at his current job, our combined income is more than our combined income when I was at my old job two years ago. 

And here’s another question to which I have yet to find an answer: If I stay in this position for a while, how do I get over the embarrassment of talking to people about my new job who knew what I did at my old job?  I ran into someone who works at one of the churches of the denomination where I used to work, and when they came into my business to get a product for the church I started enthusiastically talking about the church and asking about the building updates and the pastor.  He asked me if I went to church there, and I said, with a hesitation as I realized what I was about to say, “I … uh, used to work with a lot of churches at my old job.” I realized I was seriously embarrassed telling this person what I used to do in the light of what I am doing now.  Why am I embarrassed for doing an honest days work for an honest day’s pay?

To tell or not to tell.,"I work at a small company with fewer than 25 people. I am straddling two teams, UX Design and Marketing. I am the head of the UX team and work ""collaboratively"" with the only guy in marketing to actually do marketing. I report directly to the CEO, who is also the CTO/head of engineering. I've become the ""project manager"" of all things marketing-related and have recently launched a content marketing initiative to help boost engagement and sales. Part of this initiative involves the Engineering team contributing one article each per quarter (3 months). This is the first quarter of this program, and I have been purposely hands-on, readily available to all the engineers to help them get over this ""mountain of a struggle"" to produce one article each. I want them to succeed, I want to help them in any way I can because I know this is not their cup of tea.

The CEO's son (20-something M) works as one of the engineers at the company and has not been in contact with me regarding his article. I've sent him strategic Slack messages throughout the past two months of Q2 asking how things were going, whether he needs any help, blah blah blah, and he's been slow to reply and get started on something. His deadline is June 3rd, and all the engineers are required to have a first draft check-in with me before their due date; I suggested no later than a week out. I think that's all the back story.

My question is, do I mention to his Dad, the CEO, that he is in jeopardy of missing the deadline? More importantly, the company may not have an article posted that week. It feels like tattling, and maybe I'm taking advantage of their relationship to put some heat on the engineer. On the other hand, I don't think I'd hesitate to tell the boss of an employee who was behind schedule/potentially gonna miss an important deadline that this might be an issue and let them intervene how they see fit. What's the blowback that could land on me? My imagination runs wild. Would love to hear some thoughts on this weird nepotism triangle I'm in.",user_305,59,46

I worked extremely hard to get here. But I just keep getting hit again and again. When I got into an external facing role I was harassed at conferences by multiple men, followed, and intimidated. Told “don’t worry he’s on a short leash” after multiple complaints were made.

When I started doing really well in my career I got hired at a FAANG company and had to move from my home to a new state by myself. Then my boyfriend at the time started treating me like garbage because he was jealous of my success. He ended up using me to get a job at the same company and then dumping me immediately after he got an offer.

It was to much for me. I was living in another state away from all of my friends and family. Luckily I got an offer at another FAANG company around the same time this happened. I moved to this company trying to start over. 
Then my boss and teammate were fired right when I started. So I was given a new boss I had never met. I was also told that they would not be hiring another teammate for me. So my work essentially doubled overnight. With no raise in pay. I tried to go back to my old job and was told they didn’t have headcount. So I decided to try and stick it out.

Two years into the new job I was finally feeling better. I was in a new relationship and feeling very confident in my job. My relationship with my boss was pretty good. Then my boss got headcount to finally get another teammate to help lighten my load. 

For some reason he hired someone right out of college for a senior level role with no technical background. I was told I wasn’t allowed to interview them. When I asked why I was told that he and the VP were making an exception for this person. So instead of the usual six interviews they would only have two and no technical interview. My boss said it would an opportunity for me to help train someone into the role and be a mentor. 

The person ended up being a textbook narcissist. She looked at me as competition almost immediately after she was hired. She was nice at first but quickly began making up lies about me and attempting to make me look bad in meetings. When I brought this up to my boss he began to bully me too. Threatening me  over going to HR. He threatened my job and harassed me. Saying I thought I was better than her and to cut her some slack because it’s her first job. Again this is a senior level role..

The bullying crushed me. I even went to my VP who told me “obviously he likes you, look at your salary”. I was dismissed constantly and eventually it all became to much. I was diagnosed with a chronic illness. I isolated myself from all of my coworkers. I just felt like I couldn’t trust anyone anymore. 

I finally found a new job at another FAANG doing something completely different and I’m struggling. It’s completely outside of my expertise and my confidence is so shattered. I have a nice boss and nice coworkers but I’m so unhappy. I honestly think I should have just taken a year off. I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom mentally. All of these experiences have really crushed me. I used to do presentations, panels, help out in the community. But now I feel like a shell of my former self and I don’t even know if I want to be in tech anymore. ",user_306,62,26

Interviewing was rough after that -- between 2023 and July of 2024, I received four separate job offers. The first two evaporated because the companies were acquired or had their budgets clawed back. The third was for a government job that I'm still technically in the pipeline for, but they told me I'd have my salary approved within 2 months and it's now been 6 -- I suspect it may \_still\_ be quite some time before they're able to actually hire me; and the fourth was a role at a startup that was advertised as full time but they hired me as a contractor instead, because they were skeptical of me. They said if I did well within three months they would convert me to FTE, and I negotiated clear conditions for conversion. I knew I was being misclassified, but expected it was temporary.

I was crushing it. I managed to cut their database costs by a half a million dollars annually in the first two months by refactoring parts of their very expensive pipeline, and there was no reason to believe I had finished optimizing their spend. Unfortunately, last week everyone at this company was called into an all-hands, and we were told that our major investor was backing out and preventing the company from being sold -- so we were winding down operations. I guess I learned a lesson about startups, but I'm frustrated.

I am so tired of interviewing. I have no idea how to frame the gap on my resume right now, and I do not want to go through another round of ""let's have this data scientist do irrelevant leet-code problems.""

I have a bf who I met in the workplace, we are in different teams but started dating about 2 years ago. I am still upset over a comment made to my boyfriend by one of the older (by about 10 years) male workers on my team (let’s call him Oscar). I guess at some point, when me and my bf first started dating, Oscar came over to his desk and said something along the lines of “oh now I see why you sit here, you get a nice view of those legs over there”. Since I was sitting a bit across the office from my bf, and I was out of earshot I guess he felt comfortable enough to say that. My bf said he shut him down, and told me pretty much immediately and since then I have looked at Oscar in a completely different light. I also want to note, that after I heard this comment was made, i noticed that if you want to see someone’s legs under the desk you have to make a bit of an effort. So this added to this creep-factor for me. 

It started with me trying to avoid doing work with Oscar, and only speaking to him when he’d approach me or if it was strictly on work things. But almost a year ago now, Oscar was moved to a different team and I am beyond relieved I don’t HAVE to interact with him anymore. So I’ve honestly just been giving him short answers if he tries to speak with me or if he’s approaching a group I’m talking with, I excuse myself from the conversation. I don’t look at him in the eyes when I walk past him because I honestly find that kind of behavior disgusting and I don’t find it in my heart to be friends with this man. He’s kinda dead to me tbh.  Overall, his personality-type isn’t who I’d hang around anyways, so I’m not seeing any loss here. 

But there’s a part of me that feels like this is over the top I guess, since everyone else seems to like him (though I think some people are just being polite based on their tone when speaking about him). I haven’t told anyone, because I just don’t want to start drama. But I guess I just want to know if I should forgive and move on or if my actions are too much. I just feel very uncomfortable around him and have shifted my wardrobe to like Amish-length skirts so it doesn’t happen again. I unfortunately am forced to go to the office once a week since I’m hybrid and I do see him there every time.

2. Compare your workload with that of your colleagues’. Equal work means equal pay.
3. Send an email to your boss informing them of your inequitable pay. Email communication is important because it creates a paper trail. When management uses company policy to justify their pay discrepancy, remind them again of the law.

I’m at a crossroads here.
I am a girly girl with a high pitched voice who loves fashion and dresses. I also happen to be a super good software engineer who has worked at a couple of high profile tech companies.
My issues with the workplace is that I’m social and I want to be friends with who I work with. The men I interacted with, in college or in the workplace however, have been extremely cold to me. I feel always left out, ignored, or hit on. I want to feel a genuine sense of camaraderie with my colleagues instead of being hyper self-conscious. I am constantly thinking about if something I’m wearing could be viewed as revealing, sexualizing, or if my voice is veering into a high pitched zone. I stopped getting highlights in my hair and just feel more like dead inside. I have to be cold so I don’t get advances but then men I’m cold to are offended that I don’t say hi to them. It feels like it’s lose lose.
It has always been my dream to work for a startup. I have before though and it wasn’t a great experience, although better than big tech. I’m currently unemployed and interviewing with a number of startups. However I just feel extremely anxious about going and working with a bunch of men again. I know I can fulfill my creative passion for tech by doing a side project- I have a list of over 50 I want to do. I’m financially okay and have a lot of savings. This is going to sound insane but I’m wondering if I should just be a stay at home mom. It’s a hard job but I would get to interact with people who love me, I could have more time to hang out with my college friends and talk about tech for hours on end which is what I truly love, and I could actually be myself. I’m in my mid twenties. I know it’s not that simple, but I know I would be a good mom and I’m sick of trying to pretend like I’m not a woman or enjoy womanly things. How I would go about this is find other employment and essentially make it clear while dating I want to be a sahm soon. I’m pretty sure I could find someone compatible on that front. Please do you have any advice? Do you know any situation where you or someone you know left tech to become a SAHM? ",user_318,58,35

I just went through a rigorous interview process for a director level role. All but 1 of the interviews were done with the person I’d be reporting to, the VP. 

From our very first exchange via LinkedIn I thought he was rude and condescending. After our first in person conversation, I used the words “arrogant tool” to describe him to my husband. I don’t have the energy to get into the specifics but it was CLEAR he had written me off before the interview even started. I stopped to wonder if I was a diversity checkbox for the interviews or something?? Why am I here if he looks repulsed by the mere sound of my voice?

I should have taken my husbands advice and excused myself from the process right then, but the opportunity was SO GOOD I couldn’t bring myself to withdraw. 

Anyway after multiple rounds of interviews and a 4hr intensive take home project, I got the following email: 

**_Subject: FWD: Candidate Feedback_**
_“She doesn’t have any big ideas. Not moving forward.”_

_Hi, please see the above feedback from the hiring manager. Thanks for your time.”_ 

When I tell you my jaw hit the floor…….big ideas? At what point was I meant to propose “big ideas”? The take home assignment was totally related to something else….and the sheer audacity of that man!! 

I sent him a scathing (yet professional) direct message stating that I expected a conversation following that intensive project, and he should have invested a mere 5 minutes of his time to provide feedback since I had made it THIS far in the process.

What an incredible waste of my time and energy. Ladies, do not do unpaid interview assignments. I’ve heard it a thousand times and I should have taken the advice. 

Also, if you have a bad feeling about an interview or the person interviewing you, don’t let the potential opportunity blind you from reality. If I had followed my gut instinct, I would have ended the conversation after his very abrasive dialogue on LinkedIn and saved myself months of hassle.

Thanks for listening.

Back at the end of December, I was specifically asked to take a project with a client because the sales lady and I work wonderfully together and I keep her up to date on her clients and give her some inside knowledge to help steer conversations with her book of business. So, I took the project and brought another engineer on the project with me since I figured it would be a great opportunity for him to learn a ton of new things he’s never seen before.

So, the project begins and we are going through our workshops and he was doing the design document. Cool. I don’t mind peer reviewing the design doc. Then the budget comes out and I see how much he has billed. I found it high, but gave him the benefit of the doubt. He’s slower since is isn’t as seasoned. The client never saw those hours since it was with funded money.

I speak to him in March and tell him how many hours he can bill because there are 2 engineers on the project and our calculator for figuring out hours doesn’t equate for 2 engineers. He said ok and he understood. 

Well, I saw the budget again and he’s been over billing the client for MONTHS now! To the point where I don’t think I have enough hours to complete the work and will have to ask for a change order to finish. It’s a nightmare. 

I had a 1:1 meeting with my manager and told him my concerns. He completely agreed that my concerns were valid and threw a meeting on our calendar to hash this out. 

I came into the meeting to state how I feel, my concerns and how I don’t think what he’s doing to the client is fair at all. Plus, I reminded him of our conversation back in March stating what was fair billing. The best part was before I spoke, my manager told him to listen to me because what I have to say, he completely agrees with. 

The Junior engineer dug his heels in and wouldn’t budge on his stance. I told him that his stance isn’t going to work for me and that the project will be transitioning to me full time. My manager agreed with me and backed me up again. 

It felt wonderful to be heard and supported in a really shitty situation. I really hated having to go through with the conversation, and my manager pinged me afterwards and told me my points, angle and tone was spot on. 

Just had to share since I find this a wonderful win and gives me hope for the position I’m in and the team I work on.

I started at low end user support and worked my butt off to grow my skill set, my knowledge. Always working. I moved from user support to field roles, and with each step, there were fewer women in the rooms and meetings. Until suddenly I was the only one.

Somehow though, I had to remind them every time who I was. Calls with vendors and contractors were paused to reintroduce myself two or three times, reassure them that no, I wasn’t the secretary for the fellow on site, I was the tech on site they’d be reporting to. Yes, I knew my name was sometimes a man’s name. It’s also a woman’s name. (Side note - why was it always a man’s name first, but they supposed it could be a girl’s name too? Think we all know why…) Regardless of their confusion regarding my name, I was the tech.

I contracted primarily, moving roles every four years or so to maximize my compensation. Did as much negotiation in writing ahead of voice calls as I could when I realized the power of assumption about my “man’s name”. Dodged every subtle and not so subtle effort to shove me into sales or pile non-tech work on my schedule.

I kept telling myself I was staying at a certain level to be an example, to show other women they could get in the door. To normalize women on the teams. I gave that up about two years ago. Made the switch to an office tech job, no user interaction. HCOL but clearly defined roles. The company’s a Fortune Global 500, takes public steps on DEI, has huge pushes and sponsors large conferences.

I’m still the only woman on the calls. I still have to deal with the occasional vendor or contractor expressing surprise that Mr Me has got an admin assistant, since most in my role don’t have one. The team shirts aren’t even offered in a woman’s size/cut - because I’m the only woman on a team that spans multiple countries.

Originally, I got into IT because my father pushed me hard into technology and I wanted a job that would provide me the stability to support myself. I have been in IT for over 10 years now and have been miserable the majority of it. I find the hours too long and unpredictable (causing insomnia), work and the bureaucracy are stressful, imposter syndrome is horrendous and never gets better, tech seems to attract a lot of angry/antisocial folks, tired of being chained to a computer and of the isolation and antagonistic/distant relationships with peers, and sexism is too frequent. I am tired of being talked over and ignored, and tired of people treating me like I am dumb because I don't know x technology in minute duty like them.

Not a day goes by where I don't think of leaving. I fantasize about winning the lottery and working as a translator, in linguistics, as a historian, researcher, librarian, barista, ESL/foreign language teacher -- anything but this. I only stay in tech because I live in a HCOL city/state though I do want to eventually leave where I live.

I can handle most of the terrible things in the field, but I think the hardest is imposter syndrome and getting myself to read through all the material/watch all the videos. I jump around too much and so know a cursory amount of a lot of things, but not deep and a lot isn't sticking. A lot of my peers came from upper-class families with a wife-nanny to do all the things they didn't, but I kind of had to fight to get here and now that I am here, I am exhausted and burnt-out. The material can be fun, but I worked while in-school and in a bad relationship, so it was hard for the material to stick from the stress and it took me 10 years to graduate with a Bachelor's. Even now, it isn't sticking as much as I would like it to and I have none of the stressors of my youth and less of the motivation, too.

I am considering GRC as I heard it was lower stress and way better work-life balance, but I don't even know if that will fix my issues. Unsure of what to do.

However I am currently in a project in which a guy with an advanced role came in to replace someone else. I was already in the project and the person he replaced really knew his shit, but this new guy who came in, despite being advanced, I was not impressed by his skills. At some point I knew more what had to be done than him because I was in the project longer. Then I went on vacation and when I came back he was regarded as a super experienced person because he took 1 month to complete a complicated task (lol). Literally I went on vacation and the task had been there for 2 weeks, I came back and the f*cking story was still there, jesus. I mean I get some aspects of the story were blocked by third parties but usually when that happens I pick up smaller tasks. Frontend had asked for a minor change that took like 5 minutes to complete and turns out it was left there for 3 weeks he didn't even do that, I ended up doing it myself after I was back and was already working on a big story. He also did not share anything that had happened in my absence with me, whilst I always made an effort to keep everyone posted in the team of things that were going on.

Now he is leaving the company and everyone talks as if the team is losing the tech lead, which wtf, every time we had more complex questions we'd contact the other guy that left the project for me the other guy remains the tech lead even though he is not in the project anymore. Then I see the picture, I'll be alone in the project until they find a replacement which will be someone advanced that I might have to onboard (if they take too long to find a replacement then the guy who will leave will be gone by then and won't be around to onboard the replacement) so then the person can take the role of lead, so ridiculous lol  

Anyway, problem is, I don't care enough for the job to speak out lol. For me it's just a job that pays, I am not passionate about it and the more time goes by the less passionate I get because what I really love is something else that I can't pursue because it pays shit (social sciences, don't even know what I'd do with a degree in it). I want to do the minimum possible for the maximum amount of money and I guess if I speak out then I will have to show I am ready to do more than expected to prove I am better, which I am not interested in lol.

This makes me feel a little shitty because I wish I could do something I loved and that I am passionate about and that I could be good to show that women can be good.  However, I spoke with this guy and he also has a hobby that he would like to turn into his main job so he is not super passionate about this job it seems, but he is well regarded. Which makes me think other people in this job feel the same as I do but since they're males they get a slack on it... I mean what am I supposed to do, pursue a crappy career and find a man to provide for me? That's why I switched careers, I was paid shit and in my last role I saw that most of my female colleagues could only have an expensive lifestyle (kids, multiple cars, a house, vacations) because they had a partner that made more money than they do (lots of the partners worked in tech). If they were single and had to rely on their salary only like I did, they wouldn't have none of that. For me depending on a man is not even on the table, I'd hate that.

With remote work, almost all communication has moved to group chats online over the last few years. Anyone else experience this double standard in communication feedback between male and female colleagues? 

My mostly male colleagues typically communicate in a very straightforward and blunt written style, with no exclamation points, using just periods to end sentences. They also use very few emojis unless someone is making an obvious joke. When it comes to technical discussions over chat, their written style is very blunt and sticks to the topic at hand.

If I match that energy, I get told that my writing style comes across as 'demanding', condescending, and rude. I have been coached to end most of my sentences with exclamation points and to use more heart and smiley face emojis. When discussing problem solving, I should not use language such as ""I found the solution..."" but to use more deferential language such as ""I'm not sure, but perhaps the solution is.. What do you think?"" even if I'm 100% positive I have the solution.

I agreed to do so and the feedback was that my communication style has much improved. 

However, this situation has kind of bothered me as I don't see my male colleagues using the same writing style as I've been told to use. It's also so much extra mental load to phrase all my sentences in the most excited positive terms possible, even if the situation is not good. I also miss being able to banter sarcastically like the guys do, for fear that people will see my personality as too negative and critical. I'm middle aged and been in this field for decades, so it feels odd to be told to use more emojis like I'm an enthusiastic teenager.

I understand that it's hard to gauge tone over chats so extra effort has to be made to appear pleasant and respectful, but I do feel like I've been singled out to bear that responsibility as the only woman on my team. The guys can just type out whatever without having to second guess the tone to everything they say, and sometimes they are quite rude, yet no one complains about their writing style!

Over the couple of years I've been on this team I've pushed to improve our process and communication.

Long term I know the solution is to find another job, but that's not something I can do now.

Give me all your tips for staying cool as a cucumber during the frustrating moments of work, and keeping work thoughts from intruding on your non-working hours.

First day, first meeting, IT guy is a condescending jerk. Kept saying things like “since you’re not understanding…” 

Weird, but next up is my manager.  But this isn’t the manager I thought I was going to have when I accepted the offer. They’ve re-orged since then. 

*Three times* he reschedules our first meeting, a 15 minute 1-1. Twice now he’s rescheduled meetings after I’ve already joined the call. 

Training has been basically a link to a wiki + dozens of recorded zoom calls to watch. No one was really showing me anything related to my actual job. From the videos I started searching people’s names in slack, asking them to meet with me. Those folks have all been helpful, taking the time to answer my questions. Given me tips + more names to intro myself to. I started asking how *their* onboarding was, and *everyone* has shared that their onboarding was horrible. One described it as “opening a messy closet.” 

A couple said they shared the feedback to leadership. 

Now the director (my manager’s boss) wants to meet, and he slacked me saying he wants me to bring feedback about my onboarding experience. He wants to address any concerns I’m having.  

So my question is basically how do I go about this? I’m having a bad time, but I’m hesitant. I don’t want to come across as too negative… because, well, I’m a woman in an org led by men. I’ve spoken up in previous roles and it didn’t go well.

This happens 9/10 times and by the end of every project, I prove that I kick ass and most people learn to work with me (although a few jerks will forever proxy every question through my male colleagues, who then redirect to me, so I have to play telephone over and over to do every basic task.

The problem is, so many companies do a technical interview where you have a textbook question and aren't allowed to research, plan, think about, the answer in a coding interface that doesn't even have IntelliSense with a time limit. You don't know what the question is beforehand and most likely it is something you haven't worked with since early-career. 

It's starting to really destroy any confidence I've had in myself. What happened to demoing a program you've created, or talking about various API endpoints you've written, or doing a code review?

My previous bosses whom I am still friends with tell me to keep my head up. They think I'm great and can't believe this is the standard now.

Job 1 (the one with the offer): normal (not great) pay, but several steps backwards on my career ladder. 5 days onsite is also not great, and it's full-time in a city I don't reallly like. However the company has growth potential and won an innovation award. It does sound somewhat safe.

Job 2: would be a dream, it's a with a long established top high tech company. The role is still a little junior to my previous career but definitely still on track and the salary is also great. Hybrid, within a very international team and a city I used to live in. Feels a bit like going back but it's ok, at least I feel home there.

How do I handle this professionally ? I can't afford to lose job 1, should job 2 not work out. Job 2 will take up to six more weeks in interviews, case studies.

I am running out of unemployment in fall here in the US and at the speed my interviews are going here (5- 8 interviews, case studies, jobs are frozen last minute etc etc), it's highly unlikely that I will land a job here in the US.

Has anyone bee in that situation? Also for full context - both jobs are in Europe and starting a job and resigning immediately is not at all common. In fact, there can even be a clause in the contract that I owe the company a full months' salary if I sign the contract but don't show up.

Part of me wants to take the risk and wait for job 2, but the competition for this role is pretty serious. I feel like I am gambling with my luck. But I also know that I would not be super happy in job 1 - it's a start up, the workload sounds insane.

ITS FOR DEBUGGING, IF ANYONE ELSE WAS BOTHERING TO DO THAT. They will not shut up about print statements slowing a program down like BRO I KNOW EVERYBODY AND THEIR MOM KNOWS THAT WHY DO U KEEP TELLING ME AND NOT LISTENING WHEN I SAY THEY ARE THERE FOR ME TO DEBUG WITH????????????????????????????????????????? also when I tried to debug with the group, and they insisted we go on a call to do it, THEY KEPT MANSPLAINING TO USE DEBUGGER AND ALL THIS SHIT OR WHAT TO PRINT, OR NOT TO PRINT WHERE I THOUGHT THE ISSUE WAS EVEN THOUGH I KNEW EXACTLY WHERE THE ISSUE WAS. I cant even describe it. Like i was telling them oh i think the issue is here and about to run it and theyre like ""no its definitely not there why would u do that. go to the other file and do debugger instead at this line"" like how tf would u even know I WROTE THIS GODDAMN CODE

ON TOP OF THIS NOBODY LISTENS TO ME. EVERYBODY QUESTIONS EVERYTHING I SAY NO MATTER WHAT. When we were demoing to our prof, and came across an issue, he DID NOT LET ME FIX IT UNTIL HE FINALLY GAVE UP, WASTING 30 MINUTES OF OUR TIME. I DO NOT GET IT. I HAVE WRITTEN 99% OF THE ENTIRE CODEBASE, AFTER having to re-write everyones code, and they have the audacity to continuously quesiton me? like bro DO IT URSELF THEN. Holy shit I am so pissed off and so done and jesus christ I hate being a woman i stem WHY WONT ANYONE LISTEN TO ME??????

  
edit: I have to add this because it makes me even more mad. They INSIST we work in c++, even though I have communicated I have never used the program before, will need guidance, and we all know java, and have been encouraged by the professor to use java (there is no optimizing requirement, so I still dont know why we used c++). I begged them to consider java, but they voted against me. And then guess who ends up doing pretty much all the coding? Guess how much simpler it could have been in java? like bro jesus christ if u force me to learn a language for a project (which I know its good I finally learned c++ lol) then at least work in it too...",user_367,48,28

I learned them, implemented them, took extra care with my commit history using commits as documentation. 

I added tests, I added documentation, I wrote multiple scripts to be able to run the project in different configurations. I did everything they asked for and even added some extra functionality.
 
They didn't give a design so the design was quite basic but still worked and it was responsive. 

I honestly don't know what went wrong? They haven't given me any feedback at all, and in the other interview I had with them I remember it went so well that the interviewer jokingly asked when I could start. 

The recruiter is pushing for detailed feedback now, but I am shocked and disappointed. The position was for a tech lead which is what I have been doing for the past two years. The HR lady has been chasing them the whole week because they wouldn't give a response, and now they haven't given any feedback.

I recruiter even said we can probably challenge this, but of course I don't want to, no one is obligated to hire me, I am just shocked and disappointed.

Has anyone else considered a move out of tech? The job market, income potential for my role and ageism are really starting to make me think twice.

I am currently in a marketing operations role and the job market in the past two years is just awful. My current company is struggling and I can’t get a raise without leaving. I am great at my job and have a decent network, but it’s been hard to move up when I’m competing for every job with laid off workers who are far more senior and experienced. My income goals are reasonable on paper based on salary averages, but not if I can’t land a new role. Total salary potential has also seemed to wane a bit recently, and salary ranges in jobs are noticeably lower lately. I have tried a LOT of job-seeking advice, I am open to advice but I am seeing similar complaints in MOPs professional groups so I know I’m not alone. 

I also worry about ageism in tech, long-term. I am in my mid-30s and I can count on my hands the people I work with regularly in my company or at vendors who are 55+. Even fewer in their 60s. How are you supposed to dodge layoffs and save up enough for retirement when you might be aged out years before you’re ready to retire? 

I have a job opportunity in banking through a reference, but it’s not a marketing ops job. It would be a total shift in responsibilities which makes me nervous, but the money is great and stability and room for growth seem higher. I really like my job and would be sad to leave marketing, but I worry that I can’t stay in my role in tech and reach my goals. Would love to hear any different perspectives on these thoughts!

The PC said sure and followed up to ask if I worked with the engineer (let’s say his name is Raj) and I said yes and he was a great guy without hesitation. I assumed she had jitters about hosting the meeting alone and the engineer has been great to work with. 

She followed up with saying Raj sent a few messages that she didn’t know how to take but he’s just a nice guy (her words btw). I told her to tell our manager if she’s unsure and she said it was fine but now *I’m* unsure.

If anyone understands this, it’s you lovely ladies.

I work in a tech company in data analytics, and I am one of 2 women on my team. I’ve been in this field for ~5 years, and while I’ve had my fair share of issues, the most recent incident just left me feeling tired of being a woman in tech. 

My boss is male, and he recently sent the team a long, heartfelt message to the team outlining our individual success. Sounds great, right? However, I noticed an odd pattern in the message, specifically towards me. He listed my name first, and it looked something like this:

OP: x project, y project, z project 
Coworker 1: fantastic work at x, a master at y 
Coworker 2: a leader in b, a huge asset to c, etc 

This went on for each person. He was more thoughtful and detailed with each person. I could be overthinking it, but I couldn’t help but feel singled out in his message, as I was quite literally the only person not given any adjectives, just a list. Considering the amount of effort he put into describing the praise of my colleagues, it was embarrassing to feel like the odd person out. 

How do you navigate this feeling? I know that being a woman in tech means having to work even harder to “prove” yourself. I’m considered “conventionally attractive”, so I don’t know if that plays into it. My fiancé thinks it does (as I asked from a man’s perspective wtf this message could mean), and that feels crappy, too. 

Everyone tells me I’m reading too much into it, but I don’t think I am (at least to some extent). Considering that my job is to examine and analyze patterns, how could I not notice? A few of my colleagues noticed it as well, so I know it’s not just me. 

I know it’s not a big deal, but it does sting to feel like I’m still on the outside looking in. I’m starting to consider looking elsewhere at this point. ",user_377,46,29

The company I work at recently incorporated stack ranking into our reviews and I was shocked to hear that I did not get a passing performance review. When they were listing out things I should improve on, they directly contradicted what they had told me the beginning of this fiscal year. I’m more junior in my team (majority of team are in senior roles) and my manager’s plan for me was to slowly introduce me to the more senior tasks and projects. Everything that was mentioned in that meeting was exactly what I was told that we were going to hold off on since I was working on projects that I’ve never worked on before. My manager told me that during the stack ranking meetings that I was on the lower end of meeting expectations and with each meeting, I was bouncing between meeting expectations and meeting most expectations. 

If you had asked me a few weeks ago how I thought I did right up to the review, I would have said that I did a good job: increased project output, increased complexity of projects, more ownership, became a subject matter expert in a software for my team.. I was working so hard because I was told that if I continued with this amount growth that they were in the talks of promoting me after this review cycle was over and I thought that I was so incredibly lucky to have such a supportive manager and leadership that I didn’t want to pass up the opportunity.  I know this is just a job but I feel so defeated and under appreciated. All those late nights.. all those weekends… it was all for nothing. What do I get for that? No promotion, decrease in bonus, probably little to no pay bump. 

Would you stay at this company if this happened to you? I’m not sure what the right move is since the job market is still kind of bleak. I’m just so tired. The only good thing is that the pay is good and good benefits but I don’t know if I have the motivation to keep doing this anymore. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Sorry for the long post + rant. I’m angry and in disbelief that this happened

Any groups raising awareness at work?,"Does anyone else have a trauma / fawn people-pleasing response? (For the non-therapy crowd, it's where you were beaten as a kid and your nervous system developed a reflexive fight/flight response to appease people for you to stay safe.)

For me, it's manifested as over-paying for things or apologizing even when it wasn't my fault, just because someone else got mad and I fawned, or I was scared to stand up for myself. Especially if there's a power imbalance, which is with a lot of people, and just about every man. It really compounds over decades of career and being taken advantage of by other assertive people.

Anyways, obviously I'm taking assertiveness training and learning to stand up for myself, and yes, taking all the responsibility. At the same time, it was eye-opening to learn the root cause of my nervous system damage was from systemic inequities. Domestic violence affects 18-55% of AAPI women, who comprise much of the Tech & Finance sector, yet I've not heard a single one talk about domestic violence, yet statistically all of them have been or know someone affected. All of my friends in Tech have been, or know someone. (Curious if people here do/don't)

So not only are there external inequities, like opportunities, sexism, etc, but also internal mental health inequities starting from sustained adverse early life experiences that develop neurodivergence in at-risk individuals. (That includes ADHD as a dissociative response conditioned in the nervous system to protect from emotionally overwhelming experiences after trauma.)

Is there a group that raises awareness of neurodivergence among the dominant culture? Or trauma-informed care. Somatic & childhood trauma is already systemically distributed among marginalized groups and 70% of the US population has trauma, to the point that healthcare professionals assume trauma-informed care as the default, because statistically, it's true. I know we're not supposed to talk about trauma at work to keep the focus on work, to not seem self-absorbed or like a liability/weakness. But the reality is that it affects so much of work performance and how much potential is able to be unlocked from individuals, like reasonable accommodations being made for other neurodivergent conditions. (A common one being women work better together, don't isolate them in groups of men in a company.)

There's so much judgment on ""anxious"" or ""insecure"" women from men, especially in patriarchal world cultures (whose immigrant populations prevale in the male-dominated Tech & Finance sectors), them privilegedly unaware the root case is often due to childhood trauma, abandonment issues, grasping for validation, etc. I wouldn't be surprised if millions of pushy men have gotten laid off trauma survivors' fawn response – the reason they changed the definition of consent to be about enthusiasm, not ""non-resistance"" (gross).

Forgive me if this is off-topic or redirect me to a better place for this intersectional topic, I just had to get it off my chest and maybe sharing my story can help someone else have more compassion for how much they've overcome. Especially other young women from underprivileged backgrounds, who are maybe at the beginning of their healing journey. (Thankfully this career / economic shield has perks, like being able to afford world-class therapy and pass that along.) The internal inequities just seems to compound on external/structural ones. The conversation's underway about external inequities, opportunities, etc. but we haven't even scratched the surface of internal mental health inequity / neurodivergence awareness.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Adding a note of gratitude here to the therapists/coaches who learn & educate about neurodivergence & systemic inequities. Two of the best ones I had were white men from the deep South. Whatever motivates the privileged to be curious about the trauma of others and try to help them, I think they are proof of angels on earth.",user_108,41,10

I have developed many skills to deal with this kind of interpersonal bullshit, but my limit for dealing with it was exceeded this week and I just need to vent. 

To preface I work with a team of older men that are very stuck in the ""this is how we've always done it"" mindset and hesitant to incorporate modern solutions and technology or anything that ""looks different"" for their manufacturing equipment. I did not understand some of this when I was initially hired, but this is what I've figured out since staring. The company hired me for two reasons, I'm young and have the perspective and experience working with things the company is severly lacking and needs to develop internally if the company wants to exist in the future... I cannot emphasize this enough.. we literally have equipment that's running off MSDOS 😂 and the documention is horrible and what does exist is organized in a way that cooked spaghetti looks so viable plans to modernize it are impossible unless sometime takes the time to organize it. 

So I was literally hired for skills that will make a generational shift in the company, and I do try to be mindful that people don't like change. I try to be as non intrusive with what I'm doing as I can and also inclusive of what others think. I was told point blank, the entire team will be retiring around the same time in 10 years and they need someone young to take the reigns and be a transition. It sucks but it is what it is. I am aware that at a baseline my coworkers are going to dislike what I'm doing. 

The company at some point created a project management position for the engineering department and hired an exceedingly talented woman to get what they are needing done, done because it requires extensive planning, buy in from higher ups, cross departmental work, communication skills these men are clearly lacking. This apparently did not go over well with the men I work with because she no longer does project management for our specific engineering department, but she does for the other departments. The VP even mentioned how he thinks having a project manager managing their work was a bad move. I cannot imagine the collective tantrum these men must have had lol. Anyway, I've come to realize I'm a project manager in sheeps clothing. I do not manage anyone, I just naturally work on the things I imagine the prior project manager was begging these men to work on because they make sense to me and I have used project management to manage and inform my own work. 

I need to go have lunch with her actually.  She took me out to lunch and basically offered to be a support/mentor to dealing with the company and position when I first started. Opened up about a guy that made her breakdown at one point. I work nights so I don't get to see her unfortunately. The other reason I was hired, and this is outside the scope of this post, but it's rough. I was hired to extract and document and figure out all of the ""tribal knowledge"" stuck in the head of a longstanding emloyee who sucks at explaining things and never bothered to document anything and did everything off the cuff, who is dying of stage 4 cancer. I'm his replacement when/if he passes. I cannot tell you the emotional toll it took on me in the beginning to deal with that fucking reality.  

Onto the bitch fest. This is not about the man with cancer,  although I could probably write an entire post about all of his problematic bullshit, I've thankfully just figured out how to turn it off entirely with him. 

I'm so fucking sick of constantly defending myself against my coworker who claims he cannot understand why I'm working on the things I'm working on and takes every opportunity he can find to criticize me, belittle me, and bemoan his opinion on my work.  

He complained sufficiently enough about me (and another coworker) my manager got sick of it and started having me and other coworker log an Excel sheet with everything we're doing so it could be monitored and coached if necessary. Fuck your double standards, but fine! 

The VP of the company who will be taking over my bosses position when he retires at the end of the month was also looped into the Google doc I was required to fill out as a result of this mans complaints about me. And the VP, LOVED what I have been working on, sees the value in it, requested I give a presentation on it to the team to explain the reasonings and get feedback on what they thought. Noone has a problem with it and they all see some kind of value of it and gave feedback on how it can be used in ways I wasn't even thinking about, except for Bob. Bob hates it and he's made everyone sufficiently aware of that in the meeting. It also kind of sucks that silently working on things under the radar and trying to be non intrusive were taken away and it almost feels like this meeting was a catalyst to putting me into a spotlight and in a position my coworkers are more likely to feel negative about. 

Aanyway, the only reason the VP even caught wind about what I'm working on and is now pushing for us to move forward with it meaning I have to dedicate even more of my time to it is because of this guy complaining about me. He literally fucking caused it and is now having a shit fit because it didn't go the way he wanted.  I'm not going to lie I did a little dance in my head because it felt good to be validated and supported in the work I was doing, instead of just feeling like a damn pariah because of this guys antics. Anyway now that the VP loved what I was working on and in no uncertain terms said we are moving forward with what I'm working on, his efforts to belittle my work and criticize me have exploded and I'm also getting pressure from above to get this shit done. I spent 3 hours the last night I worked being interrogated, talked down to, criticized, told how much time I'm wasting, treated like a dumb child who doesn't have 10 years of experience in this field, told people are doing a diservice to me for liking what I'm working on, etc etc etc. 

And it's all done under the guise of ""I'm just trying to understand"" and ""I'm trying to be helpful"", ""I'm not trying to shut you down or criticize you"". No mf. You have never once in my entire work history with you, ever accepted any answer I gave to one of your questions as logical or worth consideration. Any time I have ever come to you asking for information that would be helpful for me you have told me not to worry about it, not to take notes, pointed me to use things that are horribly out of date, half implimented, horribly implimented and inaccurate. You have literally laughed in my face to one of my answers about how I struggle with my memory and it helps me organize information to deal with that during one of your many many interrogations about what the fuck I'm doing. 

No Bob it is not part of my job to have a good memory as you claimed, it's part of my job to recognize the things I struggle with and find solutions to deal with them so that I can still perform my job adaquitly.  Fuck you for laughing at me for a biological function that I literally can't fucking fix and thinking my solution for it is stupid and a waste of time. Fuck you for telling me I've been spoiled by technology because I'm 20 years younger than you and have worked with companies that used modern technology that this company is desperately trying to move towards. Fuck you for interrogating me for 3 hours until I broke down, you have no fucking idea how much I worked to stay calm and rational, explain myself, and defend myself from all of the baseless accusations you threw at me. Fuck you for trying to assign blame to me for your inability and unwillingness to understand what I'm saying. You not understanding the value of my work or accepting my many many attempts to answer your questions in a way that you understand does not mean my reasoning is broken or that I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. If not a single one of the hundreds of explanations I've given to your questions, that you immediately fucking reject, makes sense to you, that is not a me problem. I highly highly value communication and I know one thing for sure. It takes two people to communicate, one person speaking and one person listening. The problem is you refusing to listen to anything that isn't exactly what you want. 

I have understood all the things you have ever patronizingly explained to me and agreed with them and validated their importance. I've tried to explain where worrying about those things fit in my process. You on the other hand have invalidated everything I have ever said.  That is some gas lightning bullshit if I ever saw it. You do not, not understand you are just weaponizing incompetence and trying to make me believe that I don't know what I'm doing because I can't explain it well. Fuck that you just disagree and want to control me and your being a manipulative fuckass. You remind me of my abusive boyfriend that would fight with me for 4 hours if I did something as simple as ask for him to buy me a different brand of fucking soup, in order to demean me and whittle down my confidence and self worth. Fuck you Bob, you finally got to me. I broke down and cried. But I'm going to wipe the floor with you and you fucking know it.  

Anyway that's my rant. I'm open to advice. I'm not perfect and I clearly need to work on disenging from this fucking nonsense or developing even better/different skills than the ones I have. I generally do not seek this guy out and i try to limit my interactions work him because he's so negative towards me. But he started seeking me out and has made it well known he's upset I don't seek him out for help. You're right Bob, I don't, because unfortunately you're a fucking asshole and whatever help you could offer me isn't worth it for me to deal with you. I would love if I could rely on you for this shit. Also I'm intelligent, I'll figure out, and I'm not your validation dispenser!! I don't exist to follow you around like a god damn lost puppy begging you to give me information that you could freely give me but don't because I'm supposed to ask you for it.

 I think this dude is highly manipulative and I get roped into these situations where I don't even realize I'm being put on trial because it's shrouded in work speak. My therapist has advised imagining him as a todler or something non threatening, I have a hard time with that. I have trauma and it makes dealing with some of this more difficult for me than the everyday person. I know that part of this is on me for feeling threatened and taking his criticisms seriously and feeling the need to defend myself and be understood. I get it, I suck too in my own ways. My shift will also be changing soon and I'll only have an hour of overlap with this jackadil so that will help more than anything. After I cried he said he would stop badgerimg me about it but who knows how true that is. Management is well aware of his general attitude. I think my manager said he once told him he can't be on day shift because he'd lose his shit at someone he thinks is stupid and get fired. Not a people person at all. Management is pretty supportive and understanding but can't fire these problematic dudes because they have all the undocumented tribal knowledge about this stupid place. HR is not a solution, I tried that route with a previous issue and they were dismissive at best. I know I don't have to work here, but I'm choosing to for now.  I'll pull the plug if it's ever too much.  

I'm also considering talking to management about it but I'm not sure because I don't feel entirely blameless. It feels like it wouldn't have been a problem if I'd done better handling it myself. I dunno lol.",user_384,46,25

However, I find that he will often reflect on his own behavior and say “I would never judge performance based on gender”. Honestly, I feel like he’s missed the point completely.

Is there a good article or video or book I can share that explains that a lot of the ways that women are held back because of the gender bias are not strictly because men intend to judge them unequally? I just want him to understand that we all hold biases and that it’s important we acknowledge them so that folks can actually be treated fairly. 

Edit: thanks for the helpful recommendations. I know many of you have probably suffered some bad experiences with this type of thing in the past. I do think my friend would genuinely be willing to learn if I pointed him in the right direction. Even though I know it’s not my job to teach him, I enjoy teaching people and especially those willing to learn.

I've done a huge amount of work to claw my way back to health so I can work again and was provided the opportunity to go back to school. I applied and was accepted to an Information Management Master's program with a specialization in data science at a top university. This seemed like a good idea a year and a half ago. 

Unlike a lot of my fellow students, I'm not aspiring to a role at FAANG. My initial thoughts were just, ""I love data. I love solving complex problems. Data is used for EVERYTHING. I should go for it!"", assuming that I could find something that utilizes data analysis in a field where I have subject matter expertise or one that is tech adjacent. I'm feeling disheartened now that I have learned just how much ageism and sexism is out there. And then there is the state of the job market, especially in tech, and the lack of junior-level positions.

Wanted to ask, what are your general approaches to clothing for in office days? 

In my personal life I like to dress very feminine and stylish but I feel like I have to set a limit at work. I'm also mid 30s and trying to keep up with current styles to some degree and not resign myself to being a total skinny jeans cliche. 

When I had less experience and my company has fewer women I was dressing in what I called ""child skateboarder"" styles - baggy jeans, T shirts, hoodies, sneakers. Basically exact copies of what the men were wearing. Some of these were items I happily mixed and matched into my non work wardrobe, but the sum total of everything at work felt like I was doing reverse drag.

Now I've started to integrate more of myself into my work clothes, but I'm still leaning looser fitting and less feminine. Some examples:

-I wear Lulu dance studio pants to the office a lot but feel a bit weird about flared leggings

-I try to hit a happy medium with tops - stylish tees, boat neck jersey tops, chunky sweaters, maybe a more feminine or interesting fabric but in a ""boxy overshirt"" cut.

-My office is very much sandals casual in summer but as people are so weird about feet these days I just stick to sneakers 

-I've worn a couple skirts here and there but they were like denim maxi skirts, not short skirts or dresses 

-I generally try to keep to a certain level of: high neckline, not too dressy (no blazers or things that could be perceived as suiting), not frilly or fussy

-Now that nobody is tucking things in anymore and some of my work pants are more mid rise I am seeking out longer tops or sometimes layering bodysuits for midriff coverage even when stretching. This is the one where current fashion and my own idea of ""workplace appropriate"" totally clashes. I remember just wearing low rises and long tops from like ages 12 to 25! But going back there just feels wrong for work

Am I overthinking this? Is anyone else overthinking this as much as I am? What are your office norms and what sort of things are you wearing to work?

So grateful for this community! I'm reporting sexism at work, and I need advice and guidance on how to prepare for the conversations that follow knowing that people often rely on the same techniques for defending or justifying sexist behavior. **What specious arguments have you all encountered when confronting sexist behaviors? What should I be prepared for?**

The story so far:

A few months ago, I came to someone in senior leadership (we'll call him Ben) with a request (sending a company-wide email about a project I was working on). He rejected the request, saying that it wasn't needed. I talked to others, including another (male) senior leader who basically said “We should send a company-wide email!"" As a result, the request came back around to Ben's superior (one of the company founders), who fulfilled the request. I believe Ben is salty about this (wounded ego) and thinks I went over his head.

The project lead (we'll call him Nick) came to me a few weeks ago and told me that people (he didn't tell me who or how many) were coming to him with complaints that I was ""high friction"" (read: “bossy”). I know at least one of these people is our female HR director (we'll call her Felicia), as I've heard from other women at the company that Felicia does NOT get along well with strong women who have opinions.

Then, two weeks ago, I had an interaction with Nick himself where I pushed back on him. He wanted to defer to another project team member on something I had greater experience and expertise in, and I pushed back. Nick deferred to me, and I engaged with the other team member to get it happily resolved.

A little more than a week ago, Nick came to me to talk about the interaction he and I had had. That interaction, he said, showed him why people find me high-friction (a complaint, he said, he's continued to get). Rather than talk about the interaction he and I had, he continually referenced (in vague terms) the feedback from others that I was ""high-friction"" and had too much ""pride of ownership."" After that conversation, I sent him an email (by his request because he had no time for a convo) requesting that he give me his feedback directly but not attempt to convey vague and anonymous feedback from others. He told me the next day he would get back to me the following Monday.

Nick did not get back to me Monday. Or Tuesday. Wednesday, I get a call from my supervisor telling me I was being pulled from the project. He had talked to Nick and they, along with unnamed “senior leadership” (read: Ben) thought it best if I was no longer on the project. Apparently, everyone agrees that my work quality is exceptional and I’m achieving results. The issue is that I continue to be “high friction,” something that I have quite certain would NOT be an issue if I was a dude.

I will send an email to my supervisor reporting gender-based discrimination. I know this will prompt discussion and debate as people try to justify their actions. I want to be ready to counter techniques and arguments I expect people to use in these discussions/debates (e.g., “How can it be sexism if one of the accusations that you’re high-friction came from another woman?” or “I’ve worked with plenty of other women and there were no issues!”)

Especially those women who are looked down upon for having dreams of a tech career. This is why, a couple of my friends and I started an organization to empower women, especially girls within the ages of 11-19 to introduce them to tech and programming. And provide them with free of cost, online programming classes. If you know any girl who would need this opportunity, or needs just a push to enter tech, share this with her. We aim to empower every single girl especially those in underserved areas . Women empower women.

edit: for those sceptical about the legitimacy of our initiative you can check out our instagram page at [cypherz.tech](http://cypherz.tech)

This is a small initiative from our side (university and high school students)  to get women to learn a few coding languages that may give them a push to join a tech career and learn more about coding and computer. Most programs out there have some sort of fees and we are significantly focusing on women who do not have access to tech education or are discouraged to pursue it.

Almost all of the more experienced people that were there when I started have left the team/company or been laid off, which somehow leaves me as one of the more knowledgeable devs about my team's product. More recently the company has been bringing on a lot of contractors to work on it and I've done quite a bit of onboarding and support work for them, which is where this issue usually pops up. 

This is what happens: someone will be asking for help with some issue and spend a good few minutes explaining it, walking through what they already did, showing the code, etc. Then I will ask a follow-up question to start troubleshooting (""Did you do this already?"", ""What's happening in this related piece of the code?"", etc) and instead of answering they start repeating the explanation they already gave of their issue? This has happened a few times and I find it pretty baffling and irritating.

In the past I have either sat through their re-explanation and asked my question again at the end, or if it seems like it's gonna be long (politely) cut them off before they got too far in and said ""yes I understand that, I'm asking this question for this reason..."" and then they will answer it. The most recent time this happened there was also a male principal engineer on the call and he said ""I think what she was asking about was..."" and then literally repeated my question, and then they answered it. I appreciate that he moved things along, but the fact that he even had to do that was extra irritating.

Anyone else have this happen to them? Or have an idea why people do this? I guess that they assume that I don't understand their problem for some reason. Like they haven't fully processed what I just asked, and figure that if I have a question it must be because I didn't follow their explanation? Is the problem with my communication skills? Do I have to explain why I'm asking the question right off the bat? Or confirm that I understood by restating their issue back at them (""So the problem is...?"") beforehand? 

IDK it's such a small thing, but it annoys me because I can't help but feel like if a male and/or more senior dev were to ask the same question people would assume they have a good reason to ask it and would answer it right away.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for your comments, sounds like this issue is easily prevented by giving a quick indication that I understood the problem before getting into questions. I do my best to communicate well but it takes extra energy for me so sometimes I revert back to bring more blunt. Clearly have some work to do there, I appreciate the tips! 

Assuming that people think I didn't understand them or didn't understand my question, I still think this is a weird way to respond. If it were me being asked a confusing question I would ask a clarifying question back, not just repeat what I already said... but whatever! Not gonna get hung up on it or jump to the conclusion that people think I'm stupid and can't follow what they're saying. 

I've also considered that some people are trying to get me to do all the work for them like some of you have suggested. I have definitely suspected that for at least one of the people I was working with based on the amount of help they were asking of me. However I simply will not be doing other people's work, at least not for my current junior salary hahahaha",user_405,41,15

So, I did it! And I slayed the presentation, tons of visuals and the high ups jumped in and got the whole room engaged. It went very very well. Some folks were messaging me the next day saying they wished there was 10 of me. 🥹

The next day I had a meeting with the managers that had hyped me up, it was to plan a slide deck for another presentation I was doing with them a couple weeks later. Both of them have been here over 20 years, me just 2 years. They basically suggested I take a few certain sections from the presentation I just gave and talk about it a certain way. I pulled the slide deck together for them incorporating their ideas, and that’s basically what we presented a couple weeks later to a group of IT Directors from all over my state.

That presentation with those 2 managers went extremely well and may have led to me bringing in some contacts ($) for my organization. I have some discussions coming up as a result of that.

What was your experience?,"So, I've experienced sexism in my recent workplace. I live in Germany and I have to say that overall, I've had a good experience being a woman in tech here. Sure, I've had some men underestimating me or treating me differently but I've also had some good experiences where I felt like a part of the team and not judged. 

However, the company I recently started working for has been terrible. On my first day at work, a colleague told me ""I'm sexist and make sexist jokes, so be prepared"". I was shocked as I did not expect a man to say that so openly at a workplace. I also got racist vibes from him. I'm a WOC.
 I had another colleague tell me ""if I wanted to know something about phones, I'd ask my (male) friends and not my wife"". I also overhead him whining about female and LGBT quotas in leadership positions. 

The only other woman on the team seems to have become like those men and even said something like ""I'm even more misogynistic than him"" to me.

Anyway, these are the two colleagues who do the same work as me and one of them (the one who declared his sexism) is the one who was supposed to ""mentor"" me but he hasn't shown me a single system so far and it's been about 4 months. 

So, after feeling very uncomfortable, I went to HR and the anti-discrimination department. What's annoying is how many company emails I get about anti-discrimination work and campaigns, yet this is how things are in the team.

 I personally have no high hopes that any change will happen but I want to leave this place.

I made a rule for myself that I would consider leaving a job after a year if the work I've done isn't worthy of a good case study I can use for future interviews (in case of layoffs or wanting a change). And I would leave after 2 years if I've done everything in my power to get myself the experiences/pay I want to have, but ultimately can't.

I'm nearing the two year mark at my current employer, and I'm not thrilled at the lack of tech jobs, and the competitiveness of available jobs.

My soon-to-be former manager still said I was meeting expectations but also that she had heard more complaints about my attitude. No one says anything to my face, they just complain that I don't seem ""positive"".

I have RBF and people tend to drain me. My office is large and oftentimes I find just navigating the constant social performance really exhausting. I have no interest in management or training others. I just want to learn my tools, how our system works and rise the ranks through using my brains. 

When I first started I was very eager and tried to connect with my team. Unfortunately I just don't have anything in common with them. I've got nearly 20 years on most of them. I don't watch anime or play video games and I'm certainly not going to start to connect with people whose greatest ambition is staying inside to game for four says when Whatever The Fuck 12 comes out. Also this isn't my first grown-up job, so getting along just okay with my coworkers seemed very reasonable. This younger generation seems quite keen on blurring those lines and I'm not into it. If I want you to know my personal life ai will share, but otherwise, I keep it very surface.

The team brown noser had the brilliant idea to have a going away dinner for my outgoing manager on Friday. We're already having a handoff meeting to our new manager tomorrow. I plead poverty because I simply do not earn enough in this job to do anything more than pay bills. But now it's an official team builder so it will be paid for, and the unspoken pressure is on because I didn't attend the last team builder (it was at a classic games arcade with no food or seating. I don't game and I am HSP. It just sounded draining and awful).

I still don't want to go. I'm at a very large company. I came into this job expecting to make a few friends, but mostly maintain a cordial, professional relationship with 95% of people. This was especially apparent when my trainer tried to stonewall my efforts to warn a certification on time and told me that ""no one manages their cert in 90 days"" which was and is bullshit, because I managed it. He's just lazy...

The bottom line, I don't really like these people as friends and I don't respect a number of them professionally. Should I even bother with this? I suppose it's only 2 to 3 hours of feigning interest and concern, but as I said, this stuff really drains me. I can't help it that 99% of people drain my battery. I took this job because I hope to have less situations with these sort of social demands. 

Anyway, would love to hear some thoughts up to and including ""stop being a pouty bitch and go hang out even though it will be terrible."" Also sorry for the profanity but I am just so exhausted and frustrated. I want to start looking for another job, but I just started there and made a career change that, on paper, looks good because of the company's reputation.

I’ve been at my company for a couple years, but I put in my two-week notice recently. This job has been difficult for me - it’s my first role out of college, there wasn’t much of an onboarding process, the learning curve has been quite steep, and we’ve been “firefighting” the whole time I’ve been here. Additionally, the software team is <10 people for multiple products, so I’m basically the only one responsible for the web app I work on.

After I announced I was leaving, I overheard two of the other SWEs talking about it, saying things like “last time we were pretty much looking for anyone who could do the job, I think this time we’ll definitely want someone with more experience” and “[my predecessor’s name] was basically perfect, why did he end up leaving?” I really don’t think they meant to be hurtful, and I do agree that in hindsight, they should have hired someone with more experience for my role. But I feel disappointed and embarrassed that I wasn’t able to defy my limitations. I’m considering leaving software engineering soon, largely because I want to do work I can really excel in, and I don’t know if that’s the case for software engineering.

I got my ass handed to me by my boss because a new implementation is taking longer than expected. It’s an addition to our tech stack that is heavily promoted to leadership and company in general that my boss brought on. I’m not in development, although my role is technical, it’s ops, not dev. The thing is, the deadline for implementation had to be extended because the engineering team that is involved made a unilateral decision to change something with a data sync that affected a big portion of work already done without consulting my team. We essentially had to start the QA process all over again, and are still finding gaps that we already addressed before the change. I’m not their boss or a project manager so I do not manage that team in any capacity, this implementation just heavily relied on their input. I’m also not an engineer and so I cannot just take over implementation and “fix it.” My point of contact was that team’s director…I’m a manager (performing the duties of a director…but that’s neither here nor there, I get compensated as a manager and my job title is that). So it’s not a situation where I failed to escalate to their boss when I didn’t agree with the decision (that I found out about *after* it already went into effect FYI). Today, my boss said that I’m still “accountable” for how this project is doing, regardless of the actions of that team. This place was toxic before this situation so I need a sanity check if I’m justified for feeling like I’m getting set up to fail here or if my judgement is clouded. And if the latter - genuinely, what am I supposed to do? My boss became aware of the change the same day as me, he got the same email letting us know.

It’s my first time back in the office since the pandemic, and I’m trying to make that more fun by treating myself to few items for a wardrobe refresh. I know, just be yourself, but I contain multitudes. I’m going to be the most senior woman in the org who’s not in management, and want to dress in a way that normalizes that femme women can be highly technical. I remember in school wearing pretty dresses on days we’d get calculus tests back, because people should see a lady in a pretty dress getting 100s on calculus tests, and am trying to recreate that vibe, if that makes sense.

I’m a goofball by nature, and so feel like really straight laced fashion is often silly on me. I’ve never worn a suit jacket and had it not feel like a costume, and can’t do most button ups because of my shape.

What, if a senior woman ~40 years was wearing it, would signal to you:

1. She’s going to talk up my accomplishments and mentor me if I want.
2. She is will definitely ask a stupid question if I’m afraid to, and won’t judge me for having it.
3. She’s really smart even though she jokes a lot.

This doesn’t mean my manager was unhelpful but maybe that my team lead is better at prioritising? But this is an example of the kind of support I need and am not really getting. I had shared that list a bunch of times and didn’t get much insight or feedback


- I was ranting about the bad architecture decisions and technical debt in a teams service/code we had to work on and their response to me was what my ask was and to be specific. I thought they would’ve given me the solution… (I didn’t know what the solution was). He is supportive but I needed a bit more explicit direction and guidance. A few others have also ranted about this not just me  


- they don’t really bring topics or proactively tell me what I could do to grow. My skip meetings have been more helpful on this on the other hand - I’ve proactively  gotten lots of advice I didn’t even think of Eg build relationships, lead a project, spend more time on coding over the many broader discussions happening etc.  I wouldn’t have thought or known to ask these topics. There’s a lot of things I don’t know about which is why I prefer if my manager also proactively raises topics 



- they are a super fantastic technical mentor. They have lots of advice on clean architecture, system design, refactoring etc. But to be honest my weak areas are on the soft skills stuff 
- they do WANT to be a manger. They also wanted more ppl to manage. this is what confuses me is why they aren’t bringing in topics or proactively to our 1:1s. 

- they are new to my company (been here 5 months) and i suspect not familiar with the promotion process at my company. Our promotion conversations have felt kinda vague tbh. They are supportive but I can’t tell if they are interested tbh. I want to get to senior

I have spent 10 months on the job search. I have maybe filled out 2000 applications and gotten maybe 20 interviews. 

I have made it to the final round 3 times and gotten flat out rejected twice and put in a talent pipeline once. 

The last rejection hurt the most. I thought I was going to get a yes. They gave it to someone else who then turned it down. That means I am going to get it right? Nope! They are still reviewing other candidates both prior and new. That means I am not getting it.

I am running out of patience and money. I am tired of getting my hopes up every single time just to get told no. I am desperate at this point. I need to eat. 

I have no family to fall back on. 

Every job I apply to I know I am qualified for. I match around 80% of what they are looking for sometimes 95% - 100%. Yet I am still being told no. 

I know I am capable of doing the job as I have done it before but I keep getting told no. I am sick of no's. 

I am hysterical and at a breaking point. I am willing to move, do contract work, in office work, freelance, whatever. I could not expand my search more. 

I have redone my resume 10+ times. I have done countless hours of research when I get interviews. There was one job where I literally studied for 3 weeks for the assessment passed it, then did 3 more interviews just to get an ice cold rejection letter after all that work. 

I am stuck and I want to get out. I am desperate and crying. I know I can do it but no one else seems to think that. ",user_85,39,51

Question is - is it okay if I continue to be a SWE? How long can I last if I do not pick the pm branch?? I’m already the only female in trading dev teams. 

Update to why I asked - I feel it’s easier for men to stay at senior if they do not want PM track or atleast it’s my conclusion after seeing the workplace gender dysmorphia. Either women never made it to senior IC engineers or got pushed out due to sexism/ageism/family obligations. I fear I might succumb to same if I’m not prudent",user_414,36,31

I'm beside myself.

I (F) have 6 years of experience in cybersec now (about 20 y total in IT) and am a senior on my team. Over 2 years with my current company. My boss appreciates me, and I appreciate him immensely. Our company culture is a very easy-going one of mutual respect, and being easy to work with is an important value.

I work closely with another team, let's call it Z, doing upstream work that feeds their work (and viceversa, we rely on their feedback for our iterative improvement).

One of my colleagues in the Z team has had it in for me ever since he was hired (a few months ago, not more). He's (supposedly) a senior. He has a similar background, education and experience to mine. Every one of my interactions with him has been absolutely shitty. He has no respect, is constantly telling me how to do my job (which he has no idea how to do and what it entails), and on his side he's made mistakes before that messed up my work and I had to finish his work for him to unblock my own.

I didn't think much of it, figuring he might just have a bad day/week/year, and let it slide.

But today has made me question whether he's actively trying to get me fired.

This a\*\*hole went to MY boss to question my work after I pushed back on some disrespectful bull\*\*\*\* he ordered me to do (that basically doesn't fit our team's procedures that he doesn't even know - so he's basically ordering around someone who's on his level and not even in his team, to do things he has no clue about).

I am confident in my boss's trust and the good work relationship we have built for over 2 years. I then explained to my boss the situation, meaning (besides the technical aspects) that A**hole tried to overstep his bounds by ordering me around on how to do my job when our procedures are clear that it's not supposed to be done the way *he* ordered it done.

For context I'm pretty locked in to my job and my industry. It's a specialized job that not many companies are hiring for. And on top of it I am dealing with huge personal difficulties right now (terminal illness in my family) that would compound with the stress of having to look for a new job. And anyway, I don't want to leave my company and my awesome boss and team. Why should I, when A**hole is the problem here?

So my questions to you are:

- what would you do when you're faced with consistent patterns of aggressive behavior like this? How do you deescalate? How do you do damage control?

- is it at all possible to change A**hole's attitude without talking to him directly?

- does it strategically make sense to talk to *his* boss, the Z team manager? If so, what should I say?

Edit: no, wait. I actually have 7 years more experience than he does. And more responsibilities. And a smaller team. I'm almost irreplaceable (not by choice) when he's one of several/many.",user_415,38,37

It went really well. One of the questions asked was where do I see myself in 5 years. I told them that I am very interested in a leadership role. I emphasized that I am aware of the group/department growing in size and I wanted to be part of that growth and help develop processes to get us there. The executive director interviewing me was very happy to hear that answer and she told me that’s what she wanted to hear from me. I’m hoping I get it. 

Thank you all to helped me in this post. I’m glad I got my emotional moment and I was able to lay it all out and pivot to a more “I want this” approach versus an offense approach. 

Again, thank you  all! 

**Original Post:**

I just wanted to preface that I am currently working in Tech as a manager in operations. I wanted to see if there were others out there in the industry facing what I faced today. 

My workplace is usually fair and gives people opportunities to climb up the ladder in the workplace. I have been working in my current position for 4 years and I feel like I am ready for a new chapter. Another managerial level position opened in another department (still under tech) and I have expressed interest to my colleagues and upper management and everyone’s been really supportive of my move. I have my interview coming up in the next couple of days. 

After all around support, I had a 1:1 with my executive and he gave me 1 feedback that really made me angry/confused today. Apparently, ‘word’ has gotten around (1-2 years ago) that I was never interested in a leadership role. I was SHOCKED hearing this, as that’s all I ever boast about when I do my work. I feel like upper leaders have misunderstood me because someone, somewhere, told executives that I wasn’t interested in moving up (I have always always expressed interest in moving up in a leadership position at work). My direct executive shared this info with me because he was shocked hearing it too and told our SVP that was something he does not agree with because i have always been receptive in upward movement. 

I honestly feel like this has ruined the expectations I had with leadership. They all had this idea that I was NEVER interested in moving upwards in company (when I obviously was) and so they never shared any positions with me. I’ve only ever expressed interest in this new department and position because it is now available. It almost feels like sabotage. Someone, somewhere, told my SVP I was not interested in leadership—- when clearly I am. 

Anyone else face something similar?? I’m so upset.

I am a software engineer indentifying as female, and I have been in the industry for 25 years.  I took a job with a small agency, just 8 of us, and I am the lone female, which is something I am very used to.  Before this job, my previous company was charging $250/hour for principal-level work.

Recently, my CEO estimated $150,000 for a large e-commerce project for a multi-national company.  The client asked, what can we do for $50,000?, and the CEO said that he'd try to give them the basics. Well, the bills went up to $150,000 because the client asked for huge modifications and features, and we charge by the hour.  Of course, almost none of the features were scoped and planned beforehand.  And everytime they asked for something new, we said yes, regardless of the impact on original scope.

It came time to release.  I had a death in the family, and I caught a virus and I was laid up for 2 weeks, but I was trying to get as much work in as possible.  They decided to launch while I was totally sick.  I worked a 12 hour day to help them launch, and it made me even more sick.  After (???) launch, the client and the PMs started testing, and they found certain things were not to their liking.  Even though they approved the launch.  They pressured me to work while sick and grieving.

So yesterday I was told that any hour I work right now will not be billed to the client, so we are going to lose money for every hour I work.

While I was away, my CTO ""fixed"" some things.  I learned (not the easy way) that he was making modifications to the codebase in Production, directly on the main branch, and did not clean up, didn't even commit changes.  I wasted hours trying to figure out why I could not reproduce the bugs he introduced.  We have a three environment setup, and a pretty simple continuous delivery system already set up.

When I tried to spend time cleaning up after him, I was told that this is not the time, and that I need to abandon my non-production environments, and work directly in production, like my CTO did.  I told them this in not going to pay off in the end, but I am a team player, and I will try.

I told the project management lead that we are incurring major technical debt for no good reason.  I told him I feel pressured to devalue my work, and basically to not bill for hours.  He said don't do that.  So okay, fine, I will try to behave like them, because they are fed up with me trying to do things the right way right now.  

I asked my boyfriend, who is also an engineer, what I should do.  He suggested I work for free on my own time and make changes that would give my CTO no excuse not to use the continuous delivery system we already established.  Make syncing data easier between the environments easier, for example.  He says it would pay off and that I could expect a bonus from that.  I have never been given a bonus for working for free, ever!

What do I do?  They hired me because of my commitment to quality.  Now I am suffering and being blamed for things taking too long.  Things are taking too long because I am cleaning up a huge mess... Anything that is not about fixing the core ""issues"" (new features), I am not to do. 

The PM lead suggested that the culture of this place is to go ""cowboy"" when we are under pressure.  I said I have never seen that pay off in the end.

I wonder if this is the right place for me.  I have been working on the company's most profitable project for two years as the sole developer.  That client really appreciates my work.  Should I take this client and leave?

So curious about everyone's thoughts!

I work in IT support and I’m pretty much convinced I’m going to quit my job. I work with all men and I sometimes feel like I’m the punching bag on the team. I’ve brought these concerns up to HR and essentially very little was done about it. I’m in my early twenties and I’m a little concerned it’s always going to be like this. I love my job, I love what I do, and I love my colleagues outside of my department, but when it comes to those on the team I often feel alienated and exposed. 

My department colleagues tell me I’m doing a great job, but then I’m criticized by the same people for not trying hard enough/my social skills etc. I’m very confused as to what to do because when I’m passionate about something it feels like the feedback I get is that I’m TOO passionate and invested, but when I pull back I’m not trying hard enough. I want to do the best I can so I’m taking this all to heart but I’m very confused, and all the while everyone outside my department tells me they love working with me. Maybe my thinking is too black and white but these contradictions are happening so rapidly in my feedback that I feel like I’m getting whiplash. 

I often feel like in discussions I can’t get a word in. I feel like my experience (which granted isn’t much but I’ve been given the responsibility to learn tools that the rest of the team hasn’t bothered to) is never taken seriously and constantly doubted. In private, my colleagues acknowledge how useful my knowledge has been but in public (specifically our department meeting) my experience is constantly challenged. My manager will agree with me on something in private (ie: he will tell me that these 3 users need their laptops updated) and then completely change up in public (We share what we’re doing every week in the department meeting. I mention the 3 users with laptops needing updates. He suddenly chimes in with Are we sure we need to update these users?) 

It feels like a cruel joke because it doesn’t seem like I can do anything right. I’m being snapped at almost daily for being unable to complete tasks I literally don’t have the access for. But I’m doing a great job. Apparently. 

Is it just this company or is this my life now? Is this normal? I speak to my female colleagues who also work in male dominated fields and their advice to me is to not quit and toughen up. I know I need to toughen up but at what point does toughening up mean allowing myself to stay in a bad situation? Are all workplaces like this? ",user_419,35,26

I’m in the final year of my bachelor's degree in computer science, with a focus on interaction design and research. I've noticed that many with my degree often move into front-end development, as there seem to be more job opportunities there than in UX design/research.

Even though I’ve taken several programming courses and done OK (mostly C’s and B’s, 2 D’s and an A), I’m terrified of working with code. While I enjoy writing it, I always feel like my solutions aren’t “smart” enough, and I take too long to solve problems. This fear has held me back from doing solo projects—my GitHub is completely empty—because I feel I’m just not good enough to create anything of value alone. I have ideas, but I just don’t think I would be able to complete them.

I have diagnosed C-PTSD from childhood trauma and am currently in treatment. My mental health challenges have caused me to take five years to complete a three-year degree. This makes me feel like no one would want someone like me on their team, and at times, I feel like giving up, despite not having a want to go into any other field. I am currently taking the hardest course I have ever taken (algorithms and data structures), which I am already weeks behind in. When looking at the pseudocode in lectures, my mind is continuously screaming at me that this is too hard for me to understand – give up now…

I’m wondering if anyone here has felt similar at some point in their journey, but found success in a software development career anyways? Are there any people with PTSD/C-PTSD who have thrived in tech despite their challenges? I’m surrounded by friends who are talented, hardworking, and from more privileged backgrounds, with supportive families in the field. It makes me wonder how I could ever compete.

Sorry for the long and rant-y post—I just needed to share as I’ve been feeling extremely overwhelmed. Any advice or encouragement would mean a lot. This is also my first post in this community, so please let me know if I’ve broken any rules, and excuse any language mistakes, as English isn’t my first language.

Any advice on what to do here?
I am stuck with respecting my values and moving on from this. But it seems common practice here... not sure how to proceed. 

Thank you ladies! 

Update:
They gave me a call and said they can’t proceed giving me a range for the role or an offer without me surrendering recent paystubs. I told them that is unfortunate as I was looking forward to working with them and sent an email summarizing the contents of the call and my refusal to share paystubs. It’s also very funny that they tried to make me seem like I’m inexperienced for not sharing this (asking “is this your first job?”) as it’s just soooo normal that candidates are desperate and will willingly share their previous salary history. If they want to lowball me now and make me do something I’m uncomfortable doing, what else will happen at the job?

We are a team of 10 people, 5 senior engineers and 5 junior engineers. One of the junior engineers is a female that joined the industry/team less than a year ago.

When she started her work, she was great at learning new things and was able to complete her tasks quickly - even better than some of the experienced junior devs. However lately she seems to be struggling a lot since the past couple of months. I’m not sure what the reason is but other senior engineers and our manager are starting to notice this as well and I think it might affect her performance.

As women in tech, we are judged more harshly than our male counterparts. If a guy is assumed to have a default intelligence of X points, the female counterpart is assumed to have an intelligence of X/2 points. We start at a lower bar and in order to prove yourself, you have to provide double the evidence that you’re good enough and not just a “diversity hire”. I’ve been in the industry long enough to know what can hurt your career, especially if you’re not assertive enough. If a woman makes a mistake, it’s automatically assumed to be “see! I knew women can’t be good in tech” even if the male counterpart might make dozens of more mistakes but he doesn’t face any such assumption by people around him. There are misogynists everywhere but even the people who aren’t misogynist do have this subconscious bias (I HATE to admit it but I’ve caught myself have this as well!!!).

Back to the case of the female junior dev, I believe she’s smart and she can achieve great things in her career however I’m not her mentor nor has she asked for any help lately. I’m tempted to ask what kind of problems she’s facing, what repercussions the way she’s working will have on her performance and have an honest conversation with her. I might be biased since she’s a woman but I can also see how her current behaviour MAY hurt her more than a male counterpart. 

Would I be crossing any boundaries if I ask her these questions and sort of share my experience with her? It feels like unsolicited advice that is why I’m a little hesitant. How should I even start the conversation without feeling like I’m preaching her or something?

I've been at this company since I graduated with my engineering undergrad degree (so 13 years) and I've worked extremely hard to get to where I am. I am now one of the most senior engineers in the whole business.

We recently hired a younger male, I estimate about 24 years old based on what he told me was his undergrad graduation date. Keep in mind this is his first job out of school after getting his master's. Let's call him B.

I've started mentoring B him to take over a project (one of many I have been over burdened with), and his boss agreed. Naturally he's had a lot of questions along the way, and no doubt he's very intelligent by the quality of his questions. Lately, B's been following me around wanting to work on more and more together. I had additional projects of much larger scope I needed help with, so why not, right? 

Well now it's cascaded into him injecting himself into everything I do. Normally I'd take this as flattery, but here's therl problem: B wants to make changes to all of my proposals. After I say something to the group during one of my proposals in a presentation environment, he often chimes in with one of the following:
""No I don't think so...""
""Yeah/right but...""
""No I think it's...""
""No but what I want is...""

I have a lot of process improvements I'm trying to make where I only want other senior folks involved, and only other senior folks are in those meetings, but somehow he's managed to worm his way in. 

I'm going to reiterate: I have worked REALLY FREAKING HARD TO GET HERE and the business finally has time and money for ideas I've been proposing for years(which the business has been excited about). 

I don't want to be outshined by a louder, younger man. I've already had older men steal my ideas and patents them (I learned my lesson)...HOW DO I DEAL WITH THIS? 

Thank you all. I appreciate you. 

Edit to add:

B has only worked here for 5 months.

He expects he will be able to go high leadership to present his ideas and get budget (that's my responsibility).

I talked to my boss about this on Thursday and he's absolutely flabbergasted with this guys behavior. He's fully supportive of me cutting him off at the limbs, so to speak. 

On Thursday after I spoke to my boss about this, B went around me to schedule a meeting with a business leader but included me. I need to take care of this when we're back in the office on Wednesday. Any advice here on wording would be helpful.

Update:
So when B came back from vacation I had a little chat with him. I mentioned that he is far too new to be going around me trying to get facetime with leadership and on top of that, THAT'S MY ROLE AS THE PRINCIPAL ENGINEER - I make the technical roadmap decisions for my function. 

Anyway, he seemed to sort of indifferent to my comment, so I said I'd be wary that day. Later that day, we had face time with the patent lawyers about some disclosures he and I are jointly filing. One of my good friends (let's call her H, another senior engineering) was also present. She had her own disclosures as well and some she and I are working on jointly. I left the room for about 5 minutes after my disclosures with B were discussed, thinking they might move on to H's or someone else's. When I came back to the room it was heated. I could tell H wanted B out so I offered to catch up with her and asked B to leave with me. 

In the hallway, B asked if H doesn't like him and why she's so secretive. I actually felt bad for a moment and reassured him he was just reading into it too much. But then I felt guilty because I was also suspicious of him! I talked to H later and she asked what my sense of B was, and I was very honest. She said she felt relieved because she had the same thoughts. She and I have both had our intellectual properties stolen from us and filed by a man. Naturally we're keeping things private wherever possible.

Literally the next day, B set up a meeting with a business execut to speak about ""his"" idea (again, its mine, it's been something I've had on my technicalll roadmap for 2 years). I was very unhappy with him. After meeting with the business exec, I asked to speak to B. He asked if he could set up the next meeting. I said absolutely not. That's out of his role. He said he wants to be a fly on the wall, I said, again no. That's not his role. I also invited him to other proposal meetings that someone forwarded to him upon his request- he got upset with me. So I feel like I'll need to continuously rebaseline him. I'm going to give my boss an update next week. Boss fully supports me and feels B's behavior is outrageous, btw. 

I know some of you were looking for an update. I'm sorry mine might not be as exciting. But one thing I realized about myself this past week, I am 1000% a people pleaser and very open to sharing information so the people around me grow. I'm going to be much more selective, as boss has encouraged me to do so.

I don't know why?

So I (27f) started at my company in March 2022. This is my break into the tech industry; before I was working various service industry jobs while doing a local coding bootcamp to try and change careers. I was hired on as a developer and was on my first project until August of this year in the role of junior dev. My team lead told me often that I was doing really good work for a junior dev and that I had a lot of potential. Still, I do not feel confident in my coding abilities, I see a lot of gaps where I could improve and it feels monstrously hard sometimes. 

Anyways my project came to a sudden end when our next year of funding didn't happen as expected. I went onto ""the bench"" which meant I had to apply and interview internally for new projects with the looming threat of a layoff if I didn't find one soon enough. It took about six weeks to get an interview as there were only senior dev positions available and none of the hiring managers thought I was good enough to schedule an interview. I ended up interviewing for a business analyst role which I accepted pretty excitedly - when we discussed the job duties in the interview it genuinely sounded interesting to me. Bonus points, the funding is already secured through 2029 so this project isn't going to disappear like the last one... hopefully lol.

Fast forward to this month and my new team's scrum master is leaving the company. My new team lead had the idea of having us BAs take turns for 6 month stretches to build our resumes/experience. I volunteered first since in my last project the biggest criticism from my lead had been that I needed to take on leadership roles when available. I'm now scheduling some scrum master related trainings that will get me some certifications for scrum/Agile. 

I've told a couple people in the industry about these moves and they all look at me like I have two heads. They're all developers that I know in my personal life + my previous team lead who reached out to me privately to ask if this is ""really what I want"". 

So now I'm confused. In my head I traded a project I could do but felt really unconfident about for a project where I'm actually really excited for the job duties/what the project is doing and I'm getting the scrum master experience/certs so I see that as adding management experience to my resume. In my last industry I was never able to move out of the ""assistant/associate"" titles so that has me pretty stoked.

How do I respond to this while protecting my job?,"I've been at my current company 1.5 years as a ""Sr. Tech Specialist"". My new manager, ""Bob"" started 3 weeks ago and I can tell he's going to be a nightmare to work with. Instead of learning our products, processes and the WHY, he's trying to exert his authority by giving orders and trying to answer questions, but with both, he's demonstrating a deep lack of understanding in our company and the role in general. When he acts like that, it just makes it more obvious he doesn't know what he's doing. On top of that, he's so patronizing, and talks to me like I started in the working force yesterday.

Bob's director (""Larry"") is still involved in our team for now, however Larry is sexist and pretty clueless in general. Our last manager was wonderful, but I think he couldn't deal with Larry and upper management, so he left. I think Larry hired Bob because he was the first ~~man~~ person to apply. I've worked with Larry closely over the past 1.5 years, so I think this scenario is most likely. Even if Larry sees Bob not doing a good job, he won't say anything because he's conflict avoidant and won't want to admit he made a bad hire.

I'm trying to find a new job, but the market is tough so I want to protect this job as long as possible. So how do I respond when Bob tries to mansplain to me about something I already know or give career advice? In a perfect world I'd answer any questions he had about my past accomplishments at this company, or explain that our previous manager made that decision, but he's the type to see that as challenging his authority.

I worked at my company for roughly 5 years before leaving during the pandemic for new opportunities. I came back about a year and a half later to a new level as essentially their equivalent of a Staff Software Engineer. I am the only software engineer on my team of about 4. We work on initiatives that impact the entire company and are often having to be self driven and working autonomously.

I just had my mid-year review and was shown what was submitted to me for our 9-box calibration. For those unaware, a 9-box calibration is method of determining if an employee is meeting expectations for their role or exceeding in results, potential, or both, or even needs improvement. It's essentially how promotions are determined.

My review was glowing. I've been working very hard on several projects and I am essentially the reason why our team gets anything done. My manager ranked me as a high performer based off many objective accomplishments. However, I learned that my boss's direct report told him to pull me back down to ""meeting expectations"". What's surprising is that my boss's boss's boss seemed confused by it and asked why I wasn't a high performer and he simply said ""she needs to have more enterprise impact"".

Reading my review, I noticed ""areas of improvement"" are just these words: ""humility, humbleness, sharp elbows"". I know precisely who said the areas improvement (my direct boss was transparent about who it was). Our company is the kind where everyone has to agree to s promotion even if they don't work with the people being promoted. That's so dumb. However, I'm not quite sure how to process the fact someone in upper-middle management wanted me ranked lower where as others seemed to think I should be higher.

So now it seems my career progression might stagnate because someone in leadership thinks I have have sharp elbows. I don't even work for this person nor do I interact with them (though I did 4 years ago).

I'm really not sure how to process this information or how to move forward. I am working on a high profile project and I am the face of it. Everyone in the company knows I'm the one leading it, developing it and producing it. I fear this does not help with the image that I'm not humble. How do you even work on this as an area of improvement?? I don't brag about what I do, nor do I really like the attention, but I'm somehow seen negatively in that light and this project may spread that perception.

Edit: just to confirm, these are all men. The other thing is I'm not even supposed to know any of this. My direct manager just retired and divulged it to me. It fought back but was overturned. The thing is, being a high performer here doesn't necessitate a promotion. It's just an evaluation. If I stayed in high performer, I wouldn't necessarily have gotten a promotion or raise, so it's odd to me.",user_204,37,10

My boss said that my team's direction is going to change, in that we'll be a part of a new business domain and act as a ""feature team"".

My presentation was flawless: wireframes, persona slides, metrics, and a project canvas that said when to prioritize these features.

I only had 45 minutes though and I was rushing to get through within 30 min so I could have time for questions. By the time I got to the questions, I felt so pressured to keep my answers short. It was 4pm on a Friday and my panel was definitely checked out. Subsequently, I did not answer their questions very well. 

I really made a good impression in my first interviews though so they want me to interview for a different role. 

But I’m going to try to have them reconsider by sending the answers I wish I had given. 

Does anyone have experience with this? They really emphasized how much they like me. They just were worried I didn’t have enough experience.

I was hired under the previous leadership team, but since then, a new executive team has come in, let go of the old leadership, and many of my colleagues quit shortly after. I'm the last person from the old team still here, and the only female left in my team, and most of the new (male) hires are people the new leadership has brought in from their previous companies.

While the new leadership has said they’re happy with my work, I’ve noticed several changes that make me nervous about my job security:

They’ve brought in a third-party service to handle some of my job responsibilities.

They’ve hired new people with different job titles, but they’re doing tasks that overlap with my role—and I’ve been asked to train them.

I generally feel like I don’t quite “fit” with the new team culture, and there’s this growing sense that I don’t belong.

Long story short, my previous manager was really passive aggressive especially to female engineers. He would blame juniors for things he never taught and would berate in a really abusive way that skirted the line for reporting to HR. Juniors were constantly the scapegoat for bad processes or even when there was no process. Everyone that I knew complained about this manager and we would try really hard to not message him to the point of pushing responsibilities to each other to get out of it. A girl once was crying on the job because of the abuse. Specifically, this guy always assumed/implied female engineers didn't know what they were talking about and constantly second-guessed them and talked to us like we were dumb but he sometimes did that to guys too.

I think it's made me into a really defensive junior. I'm scared to be treated like that again - like I'm dumb and need to be lectured about everything. I also constantly feel like I'm not doing good enough and it makes me nervous and mess up. Now, even though my manager wants me to message them, I always second guess it, because I feel like if I constantly make myself look dumb or mess up or whenever I don't know something, they're going to treat me like how my previous manager treated me (and the other juniors). Also, when I get feedback, I can't control my reaction.

I usually get good reviews, but I think my previous workplace really traumatized me and changed how I saw myself. That place was the first time I had an awful employment experience. It made me not negotiate pay because I felt so low I didn't deserve to ask for higher pay. I genuinely started having suicidal thoughts from that place and it's been 2 years since I worked there and still feel the affects.

The manager must have thought I'd be a good fit, because an offer was extended to me, and upon opening the letter I realized the title would be ""Senior Software Engineer."" I'm fully aware that (a) titles don't mean much by themselves and can vary so drastically between companies, and (b) everyone involved in the decision thought the roles and responsibilities of this position sufficiently fit my experience, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm not deserving of a ""senior"" role and that maybe I had it ""too easy"" since I only had one meaningful interview round. 

I'm trying to be grateful for these circumstances, especially given the current economy, but I also wanted to ask -- how would you all recommend I set myself up for success in my next role? I'm by no means a 10x developer (in fact I think I'm weak-mediocre at coding, but strong at soft skills like effective technical communication), so both broad career advice and technical/software engineer-specific advice would be lovely.

In my earlier days it was deciding on little things on how/when to handle exceptions.. then it became agonizing over the best ways to structure classes/design patterns to use. Often times I'll find myself rewriting something multiple times. 

More recently this has extended out into building larger features/systems and it's getting p a i n f u l at this point. 

There are some times where the right decision is very clear to me and others where all I can think of are a bunch of options that don't feel quite right at all. In those second cases I end up getting so anxious trying to decide! And I feel like a lot of times I wind up wasting a lot of time. 

One thing I'll try to do is solicit the opinion of more senior coworkers when they have time - but obviously that doesn’t always resolve it, but at least helps me look at in a different way and gets me closer.

Lastly, even though I'm quite confident, if I do get nervous I talk for too long.

I think many of those attributes are great. But, I rarely get the respect I know I deserve. I'm ambitious and I recognize that some of these aspects are holding me back. What skills have you developed, and how, to make yourself stand out in your workplace? To get people to take you seriously?

I'm in the process of job applications and I'm feeling like I'm failing specifically because I'm ""too nice"" to be taken seriously. (JFC, I sound like an incel. Booo.)",user_440,35,15

I know I’m young and don’t look old enough to be doing this job but I promise that I know what I’m doing (at least 87% of the time 😂) 
But my job takes me into lots of places and often schools to do some maintenance or installing projectors or things like that. But since I work alongside 1 of 2 coworkers that are 30s or 50s, it seems like I’m often seen as a “bring your kid to work” rather than an employee. 

It’s just always comments that wouldn’t be said to my coworkers but are okay to say to me? 
 
Edit* removed example of comment said to me the other day 

So far the best things I’ve gathered:

- introduce myself and make it clear I’m there as an employee and not there as a helper 
- exude confidence (even if I don’t have it 😂) 
- if comments are made to me, ask them to clarify the joke so they realize it’s not funny/not appropriate 
- potential dress more professional/ get company logo shirt/other ",user_441,35,22

I had a mentor, lets call him Chuck.  Chuck and I met when I was taking classes towards a mathematics degree at a community college.  He was a self-taught programmer who learned his craft while in the military and he seemed to take a liking to me.  He worked at NOAA, had lots of experience with engineering distributed data processing systems and he was extremely intelligent.  He told me that my dreams of getting into development were entirely within my capabilities and encouraged me to apply to jobs.  At the time, I was working on help desks and wanted to break into software development.  He told me that he was in an open relationship with his wife.  When he introduced me to his wife, there seemed to be some tension there but I just wrote it off as a feature of her personality than something to be wary of.

I went to him for help with my first application, an SMS messaging app that could be used by unhoused people to find resources in their area.  Just send in the zip code of your area along with a single character denoting your gender and you would be guided to services in your area.  Eventually, I got a job in Data Engineering and he was a good source for questions I had about the job.  He even helped me to resolve a particularly tricky Kubernetes problem.  Chuck was a guide when I needed one.

Eventually our conversations veered away from technology and development, we stared to share our personal lives with one another.  He told me that him and his wife were separating, in the process she accused him of SA.  Chuck said that he didn't remember doing it and I believed him.  He said that his kids were also not talking to him during this period, telling me that his wife turned them against him.  I had no reason not to believe him.  Divorces are painful and I hadn't been in a relationship longer than a year at that point.  I told him that I couldn't be there for advice but I could be there as a friend.  We went hiking, got drinks together and he even helped me move.

At one point, I needed him to pick somethings up and help me take them to Goodwill in his truck.  He helped me with that small task and then afterwards, gave me a very squeezy around the middle hug and MOTIONED to pull his penis out.  He just made the motion to pull his penis out, he didn't actually do it.  I was really taken aback by this, I texted him to let him know that he had overstepped his boundaries as a strictly platonic friend and he agreed with me.  He said that he would never be enough for me or something a little self-deprecating...  I responded by telling him that when he gave me that icky hug and motioned to pull his penis out, I was VERY uncomfortable.  He then said he did not remember doing that, as if he just went into some fugue state, made an obscene gesture and then got in his car to leave.

I cut the relationship off immediately, blocked him on everything and took his letter of recommendation out of my Important Career Docs folder.  I sometimes wonder if the talent that he saw in me was actually there or if he was just using an assumed position as a mentor to get closer to young women.  I still get the urge to apply to the cybersec company that he works at though, they have a great product and I have always wanted to work there.

At this point, I don't have a mentor.   I pick up projects and read books on the things that I want to learn more about, but no one is guiding me along this path.  Maybe I don't need one.  On the one hand I thank him for taking some interest in developing my technical skills and helping me, but was there an implication that one day I would pay him back with something?  I can't say for certain.  I will still look at any man who attempts to guide me in my career warily because you can never tell what a person's intentions are.",user_77,35,30

I've known that women aren't very dominant in this field, whether that'd be IT or engineering or academic (CS, ML, CE etc.). To start, Im so grateful I got a a pretty good job as a current college student (CS major). I got pretty lucky to get hired as an IT specialist without an certs and pretty decent pay too. I do minimal coding for some data migration we'll do later in the year but I love my job as of right now, I'm pretty excited. 

However, I'm not gonna lie I'm still a bit surprised at the little bits of sexist comments and reactions I receive and it's starting to really discourage me and make me doubt myself :(. I knew as a woman I'll get a comment here and there every now and then, so I joined organizations like WiCyS, Women in Tech, and Girls Who Code to have a female encouragement. While in high school I did receive rlly bad comments as I was the only girl in my cybersecurity team. It was so bad because at one point during a competition I was in a dark room filled with boys and no teacher present (he went out to buy us lunch) one of the boys made a joke about me getting gang raped by them. Fortunately, he was kicked out. 

In college, for programming II I was lured into what I thought would be a study session for some homework only to be in a room by myself with a male student who tried to ask me out and kiss me. Multiple occasions have happened where a guy converts a homework session into a date. I avoid CS male students like the plague now haha.

Now at my job I deal with comments like ""Oh yeah ( male name's ) **assistant** blah blah blah"" despite said male and I hold equal titles. Or yesterday a woman coworker came in to have her work laptop inspected and I as the only one available so she kept asking for a guy IT specialist despite me telling her that I can assist her too, she left saying that she'll come back when ""(male name) is available"". I get surprised reactions when I come into a room to fix someone's desktop like ""*you're* the new IT person?"", ""Oh haha I heard we had someone new but I didn't expect them to be so pretty."" I kinda just laugh it off but it's starting to get to me a little bit. Now I feel like if I can't figure out a problem I'm kind of just proving someone's point that a woman can't do this job. The IT guys are pretty cool tho, I guess it's just everyone else. ",user_442,32,6

I have tried to make convo with coworkers but the convos always stay superficial, and after a few minutes of talking, it’s clear they want the convo to end and they slowly start walking away. I also try to smile and say hi to coworkers in a friendly manner but some of the people just keep a straight face. Even when I ask for help, some of these coworkers do the bare minimum to help or are short/curt with me, like they’re trying stay *super* professional. I have also had to wait a whole day a couple of times to be assisted by coworkers. It’s just flat out rude at times.

What makes this harder to deal with is that I sit next to a female colleague around my age, and it kind of sucks to see male colleagues do the bare minimum when I ask for assistance with my work, and flat-out ignore me when I try to make simple “water cooler” talk, but shower the person next to me with a bunch of attention. Like if she messages someone? They’re at her desk in 15 seconds and laughing with her and everything. Because we’re both women (and one of the few women in the office) it’s hard not to notice. 

How can I also be someone that people don’t ignore at work? I’m a young woman who wears makeup and shower and do my hair every day, and eat well, and I also try to be friendly with everyone, though sometimes I am a bit standoffish if I’m not in a social mood. I’ve experienced this at previous jobs as well. I’m not sure why I’m ignored but I want to change that so, you know, I can not be ignored or dismissed as much as I am. ",user_444,35,13

I (late 20sF) received an offer from Booz Allen for a data scientist role for a team that contracts for the DoD, but I'd be hired to the bench. I've worked at smaller DoD contractors before and I was trying to leave that space because the diversity is extremely lacking. I'm sure so many of you here have had the experience of being the only woman on the team, and I feel you, because same here. There were only 5 people of color and 6 women in technical positions in our department of 30. I'm the only one who was a woman of color, but most people in these two groups were unhappy with the culture and ended up leaving. Because it is defense, there are lots of veterans who are domain experts. There have been comments or jokes made in passing negatively about countries who have been the US's adversaries in the past, and being from one of those countries, the jokes made me very uncomfortable.

I attempted to spearhead DEI initiatives there, only to have leadership string me along and keep making excuses for how there isn't enough overhead in the budget, or that the VPs can't afford to have people not billing a contract for an hour. Eventually I ran out of energy to keep up the effort and figured I would find a company in the future that supported this from the get-go.

I'm wondering how the culture at Booz is, since it's such a large company. I saw they have a Women in Data Science employee resource organization and talk a lot about DEI on their website which gives me hope, but the Glassdoor reviews have me anxious. I know that experience varies widely per team, and I was told there was one other woman who is in a leadership position on the team that I'd be on. I'm hoping to be able to get to talk to her before I need to give them a response.

Because I am being hired to the bench (another thing that I'm uncertain about. Experiences here are welcome!) I think I might have the opportunity to find a team I like more. I guess I'm just trying to get a general feel of what other WOC experiences have been on average at this company.

I reflected on your collective input and while I was very frustrated with work,  my 'pen' was particularly acid that morning.  I have been working with a therapist weekly (and doing work on my own). After sharing the insights and responses with her, the challenge seems to lie in balancing my direct communication style, high introvert needs, and what I will only describe as a... powerful emotional presence.

I have adopted a persona...we'll call her Tanya Washington in honor of ""Antonia California"" that a user shared was her social kabuki sobriquet. Tanya is goofy, and she can confidently share certain self-effacing facts in a way that makes people feel comfited and that is more relatable, but isn't giving anything too consequential away. She isn't the ""real"" me and this is a necessary adaptation for a large and highly social organization. Since I've been practicing with this persona, things have been going better with my supervisor and coworkers. 

My former trainer seems to have warmed up the most. He was the one who told me that no one finished their training within the 90 day deadline. He was correct that it is rare in our team.  I recently signed up for a training class and was added to an email chain which showed our entire department and who had completed this particular training. Most hadn't bothered to complete the training and out of about maybe 50 of us total, only about thirty had it done, and only three completed it on time. Those three were my trainer, another teammate on a different shift, and me. We seem to have come to an understanding from there, though. And since he is very well-respected, he's a powerful ally to have, and as we've been interacting more positively, things have been improving.",user_407,35,1

We were often gone from our home 6 months out of the year, making it difficult to start a career (he was also mentally abusive on top of that, which didn’t help). 

At 25 I gave birth to my child who is medically fragile. She was in and out of the hospital for the first 3 years of her life, but now at 5 is finally stable. 

During these years my husband amped up his abuse and we ended up in a horrible divorce. 

I was employed for a year at 28 but had to quit suddenly when I was (thankfully) awarded full custody. Early this year I had a job for a few months but had to quit because of my daughter’s unpredictable health. Due to this, over the summer I moved in with my parents for stability purposes. 

Both of the previous jobs required me to be there in person. Now that I’m switching to tech and have the stability of family around, I feel more confident about entering the technosphere - especially as a Project Manager. 

However, I’m concerned about how to explain the huge gap in my resume. I’m pretty transparent on a personal level, but recognize how that can end up as a disadvantage professionally. I truly do not see any other option besides honesty, or a version of it such as, “taking care of a sick family member”. 

Ideally, I want to be as private as possible. I would much rather people not know my age (30), circumstances, history, about my traumas, relationship status, sexual orientation, child, etc. 

But, everything I’ve heard about tech in WA tells me I don’t have much to worry about because of the diversity in Project Management. I’ve heard this from women, men, CEO’s, hiring managers, etc. all who I personally knew. When I asked them this very question, how to explain the resume gap, they all suggested to frame it as professionally as possible and to leverage my resiliency as a strength rather than a “pity party, give me a chance” sort of thing. 

I’ve done a ton of work on myself over the years and come across well professionally. Once hired, I am confident in knowing how to navigate the culture. 

This resume gap is the only hesitancy I have and would love some insight❤️


Edit to add: Before having my child I did freelance interior decorating. My husband was the LLC holder at the time (stupid, I know) and although I LOVE it, he told me it was just a hobby and not a real career. I stupidly believed him and even still forget that I used to do it because it was minimized so much😕

I've talked to my psychiatrist and she agreed my condition meets the requirements for FMLA, but I don't know if I can even make it the 30 days a regular notice requires. Last year, I had to take FMLA for even worse anxiety and depression, and the HR person was upset that I didn't give a 30 day notice. I've been told elsewhere that I don't need to give the regular notice for immediate medical issues.

But like, I don't care. I know I'm not in a good headspace, but I can't continue with this. I'm not dealing with TW ||suicidal ideation||, but I know I'd choose my life over this job. I at least need this medical leave so I have more time to find a new position. I do have short-term disability this time around, I'm living with my parents now, and I've built up my savings, so I'm not concerned about running out of money or going homeless. 

My friends in tech, including my former partner, believe I'm worth so much more than this. They also advised I work less to preserve my mental health. Several people have told me my experience (5 YOE doing GIS at a FAANG) is just about ideal for transiting into developer roles.",user_455,33,0

They are so talented and our organisation would benefit enormously if their talent was shared. So I write documentation that is user friendly and I hold workshops internally to educate the rest of the engineers outside our team. But I’m the most junior in my team and so I often fall behind their knowledge of what we are building, and spend a lot of time learning intensively so I can share the knowledge. And then it just struck me today, why aren’t they sharing it? I’m becoming a bottleneck. Why aren’t they writing better documentation and hosting more sharing sessions? Everything is set up for that, but they never volunteer. 

Would you call this weaponised incompetence? And how would you go about changing it? What other types of weaponised incompetence have you witnessed in the tech industry?

They are all men. They are themselves good friends with each other. But when it comes to me, the younger folks talk down to me.

In the initial days, one of them chuckled, ""oh they hired you since you're a girl"". I told him I was the only person who scored a 100/100 in their DSA round amongst 10+ candidates. This guy's three years younger than me, and writes really vulgar code*. But that's ok; we all learn from each other. What matters is how he behaves with me when others are not around. One time he asked me why I am not married yet as I am old enough. I smiled and told him he's talking way out of his limitations. But then I thought I should have made him feel bad. It's not like he would ask any of the senior male folks about their personal lives. He uses sarcasm as a means of replying to me. So today I did the same.

*[Vulgar code is a programming jagron, it means he writes really bad computer logics at work.]

Another guy pointed me out as the ""diversity inclusion"" team member. A lot of casual sexism is just thrown out there and I don't like it.

I try to keep my conversation minimal with these guys but we have to talk regarding work and let's say while the code is running and we are on call, one of them will divulge in a random conversation.

I sometimes want to tell my manager that I want to switch to another team, because of his other team members, but I like the work. It's exactly what I wanted a couple of years ago.

What if my manager questions me further? I don't want to severe ties with him. He knows them for far longer than he has known me. He's one of the best managers I have worked with so far. Doesn't talk a lot, unless it's about work. Always willing to resolve doubts and answer questions. Does not micromanage. We don't have to beg for leaves. Other teams have it worse. For example, their manager calls on the phone if they don't log in at 9:30, etc. Their leaves get rejected left and right. They are not allowed to WFH for a long time and work hours are a myth.

My manager is generally happy with me. I have anyway plans and it's not like I am planning to stay in this company for my entire lifetime, but my teammates' behaviour is annoying. I have ignored what they say so far, but beyond a point now I feel angry.

Any thoughts, senior dev folks? Not sure if it might help any of you to further analyse the situation, but I am based out of Bangalore.

EDIT:
It took me a year to process things as I kept ignoring my teammates' behaviour. Had I posted this post six months ago, things would have been better. But, thank you all for your responses. Now I know better how to handle things.",user_459,32,22

Now that some time passed, I made progress with my colleagues and we are much closer. (I did not read my old post before creating this new one)

Keep in mind that even though I live in Eastern Europe, I think my team is very friendly (at least now).

In my opinion, what I did the best was ""team-bonding"" with each colleague of mine. I tried talking / asking for help / trying to help colleagues that I did not speak with a lot before. And usually, we also sometimes talk about personal life (not too personal of course). This resulted in us being closer. I also noticed that we talk more in dailys now. (From 5 minute of non-work related convos to 20 minutes for example)

I was feeling bad because I didn't receive a lot of ""good jobs"" from my colleagues. But then I realized, they rarely get them too. So, everytime someone said something and I thought of it as a good idea, I said in the meeting that ""I think X has a good idea"". Or in the demo/retro, where credits can be given, I give them (keep in mind that here if I think I did a good job I also mention me). After that, they also started doing that, and sometimes they give credits to me. 

People started to give me code reviews. It started slowly, but once they saw that I was very careful with the reviews and noticed problems or things that can be improved, they gave me more. When I am doing a review and I like how someone tackled the problem (maybe with a solution that I would never think about), I am complimenting their idea either on chat messages or in the daily. 

Keep in mind that I only give compliments when I think someone did a great job. I do not abuse this, because it doesn't feel special anymore if you abuse it. 

This especially happened when I noticed that a colleague had a problem for over a month, and another colleague (both men) insisted that he tries a solution. He never listened to the solution. So when I had the same problem, I told him to send me the messages describing the solution, and I tried it that day. I guess he felt pretty good about someone that finally listened to what he said. After that, he is now the first one to offer me help when I need it (since he has much more experience), and I appreciate it everytime.

I do not do more than what I am asked for. And if I do, I always mention that this is out of the task's scope and that it will take me longer. 

Usually in a day I make notes with everything I did a day before so that I don't stutter in meetings.

I am writing more on the team's chat to inform people about the progress of a task instead of my teamlead, so everyone can see. Or if I discover something.

Other things that I have noticed is that men don't really hold grudges. And they tend to be more unhinged =)) So even if it's hard to do this, ""don't take it personally"" is the best advice I took, because most programmers (especially men, no offense) are socially akward and don't follow social rules.

If I feel like my advice is not listened to, I stop from giving it. I only say ""write/call me if it doesn't work"". I will not beg to be listened since it is not my task. 

If I feel someone is passive agressive, I call them and ask nicely what he meant by that remark (this only happened once).

I don't care what other men from other teams say. I do not have to interact with them each day, only maybe once a month for a task that requires answers from other teams. Out of sight, out of mind. 

At the end of the day, each of us is a person. Sometimes we have good days, sometimes we have bad days. But I think it's important to be in a team where everyone is happy instead of being stressed. Everyone should feel important. And since we spend 6-8hours a day with each other (either remote or in an office), we need to be united.

For me it was a happy case. I'm sure out there are some men/women who do not know how to properfly work in a team. And that's on them, not on you.

I hope this post helps someone ^_^


Update: I forgot to mention, but I also started talking more. Even if it's a small observation. Even if maybe it's wrong. They have to hear you so they know you care and engage. I think in the beginning I said like 9 things wrong and one right. Now it's the other way. You have to ask stupid questions to grow. And I really learned like this.

Hi all, thought I’d share the below from my network. This is a fantastic program!

——————————————————————
Meta's RPM (Rotational Product Manager) Applications for 2025 Open now

What is the RPM program: The RPM program is an 18-month developmental program designed to give people the skills and competencies needed to become a successful PM at Meta. You'll go through 3 6-month rotations, working on different products across Meta. 

5 FAQs I get during this period:
1. I do not have prior PM experience. Can I apply?
Yes. In fact, the RPM program is a highly sought-after program at Meta as it's one of the few ways for aspiring PMs to experience product management at Meta. The application period is from Tuesday, August 27th - Tuesday, September 10th.

2. Can you refer me?
No. The RPM program does not take referrals. The only way to apply is via the metacareers website during this window, to ensure equitable access for all applicants. If anyone is promising you a referral for $$, it's a scam.

3. I am from a non-technical background. Can I apply?
Yes. RPMs are hired from a variety of technical and non-technical backgrounds, including recent graduates and people with full-time experience in various roles/ industries.

4. Will my application go through an ATS system?
No. Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis, and all applications are reviewed by recruiters. 

5. How do I submit a strong application?

This is my first post here and I’m hoping for some guidance from anyone that has experience with taking a sabbatical/mental health leave. I’ve been working in the tech sector since 2009 and have gone through various phases of burnout. The first serious event happened in 2015 after years of putting up with and finally reporting harassment. My gov contract came to an end in 2016 and I chose not to look for new work. I spent the next year recovering and traveling within the US. I got a new job in the beginning of 2018. Since then I’ve gone through more burnout. I went to the hospital in the summer of 2020 after dealing with symptoms related to stress, severe heartburn and acid reflux. I could barely sleep, eat and was working nonstop. Since then I have completely changed my work style and have created clear boundaries about how much I can work. But I am finding myself dealing with projects and consequently people that keep trying to push those boundaries for the sake of meeting project deadlines. Right now I’m dealing with a project that is poorly staffed and we are working overtime everyday to stay on top of things. I’m struggling and finding myself wanting to put in my notice and be done with it but I know that’s not the right solution. I do however want to explore the option of taking some sort of mental health leave once this project wraps up in the fall. I can sense my body is going through a lot of stress and Im worried that if I don’t manage it I’ll end up in the hospital again. 
Has anyone successfully taken this type of leave and how did you initiate that process through HR? How much time did you take off and what did you do during your leave? My other concern is coworkers finding out about my reason for taking leave. I’m very private about my personal life at work and don’t want anyone knowing why I’m taking time off. I’m not ashamed but I don’t want to get into the details with coworkers since everyone’s experience is different. Thanks everyone for reading and any advice you’re able to share!",user_478,31,17

For the rest of the projects, during meetings I have realised that the rest of the projects are, first of all group projects, secondly very intertwined and I can hear them around often brainstorming together as those projects need each other.
The only interactions I’ve had with my coworkers have been during lunch breaks, but after a few instances where they forgot to invite me, I’ve felt uncomfortable joining them, feeling unwelcome.

The core issue is that my project is the only solo project on the team, and while I’m excelling at it, I don't get to collaborate with others. When I was interviewed, my manager assured me that I’d be assigned a different project once this one was completed. Despite the challenges, I haven't needed much help, except for occasional guidance from my supervisor, who has praised my work multiple times.

However, my manager rarely comes into the office, often working from home, so I don’t have much direct contact with her. Lately, I’ve sensed that she might prefer I leave the company, possibly because my colleagues perceive me as standoffish. I even overheard her laughing about a colleague knowing I even existed, which makes me worry that the next project I was promised may never materialize. I fear they might be looking to replace me with someone who ""fits better"" into the team dynamic.

This situation has left me feeling incredibly frustrated, as I’ve never experienced this kind of isolation before. In the past, I've always made friends easily, whether at school or work, especially when working in teams where talking to each other is essential. I'm good at socializing once I'm comfortable, but I never feel at ease in this workplace. It’s frustrating because I know this isn’t who I am, yet that’s how I’m perceived,  a snob. I dread going to work, and the only reason I continue is the paycheck and the current job market. I know I'm skilled at my job, but I also know that being socially engaged can sometimes be even more important. I am certain within a few month I would be laid off. ",user_480,29,9

I frequently have an opportunity to speak in front of 300 and more people. Afterwards, some people congratulate me and stress that they've learned a lot. Others don't like the presentation.

I guess that's normal. Such large audiences consist of people with different backgrounds: some are technical (to different extents...), and some are more business-oriented and won't even understand what I'm talking about. Not to mention that people have different preferences concerning the speed and the expression.

Besides, I do work on my presentation skills, but as one distinguished expert once told me: you can be perfectly prepared and still bomb it; there are factors independent of you. Having done many presentations in the last few years, I agree with him. You can and should prepare, but you aren't able to control the result completely. You can feel horrible on the day, or the audience may be misled about your presentation and not be receptive.

And let's not forget the gender-based criticism. Where I live, I'm in an absolute minority as a speaker. It's normal to have 10 male speakers and just one woman: me.

My problem? I'm dying inside with every piece of criticism. Frankly, even if a person whose presentation style I hate tells me they found my presentation ""boring"" or that the speed was horrible, I feel awful, although I know I shouldn't care.

I hope this question is fine here, even though I’m a dude. 

I’m incredibly despondent after last night but I really want to channel that into something productive. I think beyond just financial donations to just causes, I’d like to also mentor folks and am at a loss of where to start. 

As a hiring manager + principal software engineer at a large tech company , I’ve been trying to help grow our diversity but failing because there’s just not very many women or people of color or other minorities in my field of computer graphics who are also senior enough. As it is, I am one of the only minorities in 90% of industry meetings.  

So I feel the best impact I can make is help earlier in the career pipeline by mentoring people in this field. Either more junior professionals or people still in their educational stage. 

I thought I’d ask the great women here if they had any suggestions of where to mentor, or how I might help in other ways. 

I’m somewhat mobility impaired myself so online is best. 

I looked at Girls who Code , but can’t seem to find ways to volunteer to mentor online. 

Any help is appreciated. I want to try and avoid wallowing any more than I have today, and focus on something meaningful. ",user_484,29,25

What should I do?,"I’ve received an informal notice that my promotion is delayed yet again til early next year, while I’ve pursued this process for 6+ months. Unsupportive management, troublesome office politics, and rigid corporate structure seem to be the main drivers of this delay, but I’m in the middle of a green card process with my company and would not be able to leave until this is complete (and out of good faith), about 2 years from now. What can I do to improve this situation?

Some context for my case:
- Last year, a mass layoff happened, reducing our core team by half, leaving just basically myself and another teammate to take care of the work.
- Current manager “inherited” me when my previous manager was affected by the layoff. She has not been very effective and was creating a lot more bottlenecks within internal processes, but I can talk about this another day. 
- A few months later, due to the straining workload, my only other teammate quit. The team became just me and my manager, so I was doing 3x the normal workload. Having been here for 5 years, I also became the person with most institutional knowledge in my broader team, as my manager and most of current management joined later after a leadership shift. 
- At this point, it was March, and I proposed a title change and additional comp. This was also around the time annual reviews were done, so I was hoping I would be included. Manager and her manager (who reports directly to the CEO) said they were supportive but promotions were not being considered at this time, and we would have to push for summer. However, I immediately learned that this was untrue because several promotions in adjacent teams were announced right after annual reviews wrapped up.
- After a few more months of me doing triple the work and overhauling a huge migration (that touched all parts of the department and was fully recognized by leadership), they re-filled the spot with a higher-ranked position. My manager also went on a month-long vacation and left me to tend to the team. For me, this meant additional work, onboarding a new team member, and taking care of all managerial tasks on behalf of my manager. I checked in with my skip about the summer promotion cycle and then was told he was behind it but by this time it would be an off-cycle push, aiming for fall.
- My manager came back from vacation and my petition for green card was filed. This meant I wouldn’t be able to leave my company until the petition is done, as that would be synonymous with leaving my sponsor and giving up on the process. I checked in once again for the fall process, and was now told I would only be considered for 2025.

I felt like the goal posts kept being moved, and since they are fully aware I would not choose to leave, empty promises were thrown out to keep me working. I would appreciate any advice of how I can better push for this and make sure I can get my promotion as soon as possible.

I hope the question doesn't sound ridiculous. There's a lot of male executives in Tech who are DJs. David Solomon of Goldman Sachs (though [he stopped publicly](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/17/goldman-sachs-ceo-david-solomon-dj-gigs-d-sol)). Web3 founders, backed by a16z, etc. I cannot think of a single woman – not at least publicly, and especially not at the senior/exec level.

Could you imagine the public reaction if Sheryl Sandberg or Susan Wojcicki (RIP) tried to DJ or make music? (Or maybe it's fine now, idk – Gen Z come thru.) Meanwhile, Elon Musk is acquiring founders he gets into meme wars with on Twitter. The double standard in behavior is suffocating.

[Avalon Emerson](https://www.instagram.com/avalon9000) was a software engineer in eCommerce. I know of a [Tech journalist](https://www.instagram.com/arthi.nachiappan/) who is a pro DJ. And an acquaintance who's a Product Designer. How would one handle it? I see 2 options: 1) Promote your art in social media, if your employer is conservative then hide from your colleagues 2) Promote in other channels, closed groups, word-of-mouth, and not social media.

Asking because I don't know how to be.. me with this career. The ""acceptable"" (read: promotable on social media) creative hobbies for women in this line of work seem to be, like, novel-writing, pottery-making, even fashion design. All of those would be a watered-down version of my creative expression. and many other women's. Even a generative artist like [Sougwen Chung](https://www.instagram.com/sougwen) who's dabbled in techno has to be super refined.

Can people's brains accept that someone can be super reliable at delivering business results and be super artistically expressed, and not be a man?

It's all so... unnaturally oppressive, when a certain demographic can't *just be their authentic selves*. Then we get health issues because our emotions are so suppressed.

Fast forward weeks later my manager tell me Someone from the scrum team complained that I wasn’t talking about what I was struggling with and voiced my struggle too late. Instead of talking to me about it they complained to my manager. This is my first development story, no one made sure to ask my approach/design, everyone has been developing continuously for a year and I’m slow compared to them.

And look I get put on my first ever assignment that was so horribly complex and had no one mentor me or ask if I was struggling, just complained behind my back… this is a fang btw.

I’m part of a team of 10, but only he and I do our specific job. I personally recruited him to be my colleague, and at first, it was great. We were on the same wavelength, became friends, even started meeting after work, and we now have mutual friends. Occasionally, we have conflicts. Twice, we had intellectual arguments on topics I know a lot about, and I was right. He spent an entire hour looking for proof online that I was wrong (and didn’t find any) and refused to admit he was wrong. Both times, he ignored me for the rest of the day. He’s constantly looking for mistakes in everything I do and trying to correct me, even if it’s not really a mistake but rather a rule he made up for us. I don’t think it’s relevant and it just prolongs the work on internal projects or something short-term/few people will see, and we should focus our time on more important projects instead of wasting hours on unnecessary details.

He also makes mistakes constantly, in small or unimportant things. I just correct them and say nothing because not everything needs to be pointed out, and I don’t want to humiliate him like he does to me, nor do I want to get into conflicts with him. He’s a man, I’m a woman, and while everything seems fine, there is clearly some misogyny, and no matter how enlightened he is, it has come out a few times.

As for our boss, he likes me a lot, but if I initiate something, I always get a no, while my colleague has gained a reputation for having great ideas that get the green light. It really annoys me. He does this on purpose, and if I initiate something that gets approved, I involve him in meetings and give him credit, but he never informs me when things are happening.

I trust my instincts, there’s no point in saying anything. I’m a woman, he’s a man, I’ve been through this a thousand times, it’s a lot of small jabs and nothing concrete that I can point to or complain about, and any complaint from me will backfire, I know it. I just wanted to vent.

I’ve worked in three places where I was severely bullied, two of them by my manager. I don’t want to leave my current job; I’ll never find a place as good with such conditions. I’m just tired of it happening everywhere I work, and this time from someone I thought was a friend. You just can’t trust anyone, and I don’t think I’ll ever find a place I’ll love working at.

For context, I am late 30’s and lead a team of 6 guys doing helpdesk, endpoint support, and A/V technology at a college. I have been with the team for 2.5 years. I have one team member, let’s call them Chad, doing helpdesk/endpoint support. He has been an issue since I started.

He is a bully, not very self reflective, and thinks he’s always right. He creates a toxic work environment for everyone. The two new guys that share the office space with him have gone home physically ill because of Chad’s behavior. The last year has been better because he was put on a performance improvement plan and one of his close friends left the department. 

Outside of that every time I set expectations he ignores me. Not only does he ignore me but will actively tell me he is going to not do it. Everything I ask is a fight or requires me to follow up in writing. Because of these there are no conversations or collaboration. It is mostly me dictating and getting input from people privately. 

Last year his behavior was so bad he did a performance improvement plan because my CIO is afraid to let him go because he’s “productive.” Chad met every flipping deadline. He was good for the summer and going back to old behaviors. One idea that has been floated is to put him in a vacant position for our second A/V person and add in some other responsibilities as our network admin’s second set of hands. This would remove him from his current office, the helpdesk, working with my students, and reduce his customer interaction by 70-80 percent.


I think the idea has potential but if I think about it too much the thought of him in any role gives me a pit in my stomach. HR says I can non-renew him at any time since I have done a great job tracking everything. I am very conflicted and need advice.",user_494,27,26

I’d love to know what others spend their work days doing. For me, it’s debugging. 

I am on three projects at the moment. I had been off one project a while and was put back on. There were errors in the code. I spent two days solely debugging the code to make it work. 

I am currently mentoring someone where we are using an open source project. It didn’t run out of the box. More debugging. This has been about a days worth of work. 

Another project I work in a simulated environment. That code isn’t working. I will probably spend next week before time off getting that to work. 

TBH I love debugging but I also want to actually write code. Is this normal for other programmers at their jobs? I don’t know if it’s about me having multiple projects to work on or what but I feel like I don’t spend a lot of time actually writing code…

I’m new to tech, started 10 months ago. I’ve never had a proper tech review ever—just comments left on a PR for me to figure out. Never once has a senior gone over things with me.

I’ve noticed that my PRs are heavily scrutinized in comparison to my male co-worker. In fact, I noticed that my male worker may have done the exact same thing as myself code-wise but nothing is mentioned but for me it’s the opposite.

Comments  I got on a recent pull request were : “this looks aggressive” and “weird formatting” and “spaces” —literally one space.

I challenged him on these comments and he said “must be how my settings are, looked weird to me” this tells me he isn’t even really properly reviewing my MRs, just looking on Gitlab.

Plus, I’ve had to ask him repeatedly to review my work and it took him 3 weeks.

How can I be strong and handle the nitpicking?

I asked if we could call and have a proper review as I have questions about his remaining comments and he left me on read on Teams.

How can I handle when I give a suggestion, it gets shot down, then my male coworker gives the same one and it’s approved? I’ve even joked with said co-worker to just suggest things on my behalf as I know he’ll be listened to and I won’t be.

Plus, how can you get over comments like: “you’re a beauty and brains” when I know this person would never say this to my male co worker.

Earlier this year, I had to quit my job due to some mental health issues. Trying to keep things vague but I’ve been unemployed for almost a year now. The first \~5 months of my unemployment were terrible because I was severely depressed and wasn’t getting anything and I mean ANYTHING done. Forget work/studying I couldn’t even get myself to do things that I actually enjoyed. 

A few months ago, things randomly started feeling a little better, so I decided to start studying full stack development as I currently don’t feel I know enough/have any projects to actually job hunt with. This has unfortunately been a very slow process for me. I’ve been telling myself to just take it one day at a time and that any progress is good progress, but the longer I go at it the worse I feel. 

I feel like I’m killing my parents with all the stress I’m causing them, and I genuinely don’t know when this is all going to end. Even if I had all the projects/knowledge necessary to job hunt right now, the market is trash for entry-level devs so it’d take me months, maybe even a year to get a job. Also, the tech market for the state I’m in is mostly full of defense contractors, so all of those jobs require a security clearance which I do not have.

I feel especially bitter because as I was struggling through my degree, I had people all around me telling me I just have to work hard, graduate, and then there’ll be plenty of good jobs to pick from. I still remember one particular moment in my sophomore year where I was on the floor of my dorm sobbing and sobbing because I was having a hard time figuring out a CS project and feeling hopeless. What got me to pick myself up and get to work was telling myself it’ll all be over when I graduate. I’ve graduated, got a year of experience, and I feel like I’m worse off now than I was before.

I keep trying to tell myself that I’m doing okay because at least I’m not in the same spot I was in months ago, but it’s getting hard trying not to fall back into deeply negative thoughts. I don’t even know what the point of this post is, I’m just feeling really down today. I guess I’m ranting + seeking advice but I don’t even know what advice I’m seeking??? All I can do right now is keep moving with my studying but I’m terrified that this will all be for nothing.

But it’s been years since I was actually happy at work. I have self diagnosed anxiety and a pretty strong “fawn response” stemming from some childhood trauma. People pleaser x1000, perfectionist somehow mixed with procrastination. If I can make people happy, I’m safe. Pretty much every obstacle at work causes my heart rate to spike, I wake up at 2 am freaking out about work, I cant handle negative feedback without obsessing over it, I get so defensive about negative comments about me or my team. I’m butting heads with a male colleague right now because of arrogance and role ownership, and I just cannot shake it off at end of day. 

That said -I am well respected and generally people like me. My team loves working for me. I keep getting new opportunities because leadership respects me. I use that anxiety and shame to make sure the response is perfect, the project goes live, the people are happy, and people still like me. 

I know I need therapy for the childhood trauma and to deal with the anxiety. But I keep thinking - what if that need to people please IS my secret power? Or what if the job is actually just that bad and if I could get the RIGHT other job all my problems would be solved? And until I’m fixed (ha) how do I handle this conflict resolution with these colleagues when every cell in my body screams at me to just give in and make them like me?? My husband and several friends are in therapy and tell me some of the advice they get - but none of them are in corporate jobs or women in male dominated fields. So I need a therapist who understands this space. But also a mentor who can help me figure out the culture appropriate response to some of these arguments. And then a career coach to help me figure out if IT management - project driven work in such a collaborative group - is even the right use of my skills considering the drawbacks.

Feel free to skip but here’s my general thoughts on my job- the culture trends intense, and I am the only female engineer on my team and mostly working with men who are at least a couple years older than me. All leadership is men, some of whom are a little harsh (one time I wasn’t getting something right away and my coworker told me I need to update my brain when I get new info lol). I am a sensitive flower who does well with positive validation (which I very rarely receive but that’s ok.) My manager is smart and fair but can definitely be intimidating.

I found this sub a few weeks back while researching short term disability for mental health so that might help set the tone for where I’m at, but I’d love any advice/guidance/suggestions/cold hard truths. Major apology in advance for the length, but appreciative to anyone who read its. 

Background: I’m mid 30s with no degree. I had been in retail management/product development for over 10 years in niche areas, museum gift shops and bookstores. In 2020 I was working customer service for an e-commerce site that exploded during lockdown. With a large amount of stresses and pressure (work and non-work related) in Sept 2020 I had a pretty serious mental health crisis and became a danger to myself. It was a bit of a wake up call for a lot of areas in my life but how it related to my career was that I felt like I hit a breaking point with making pennies in exchange for two weeks off a year. I have NEVER been career driven, but decided to do a full stack software development bootcamp in 2021. I completed it that summer and less than 6 weeks after I ended up with 3 offers to choose from. I ultimately went with a consulting company that offered the highest salary and had unlimited PTO (this is actually my highest priority in a job).

Now: three years later I’m with the same company I chose and I’m miserable, burnt out, and stuck in a hardcore motivational freeze. I was diagnosed with treatment resistant, clinical depression almost 13 years ago and recently diagnosed with OCD, but I do a LOT to keep my mental health prioritized and in an okay place after 2020. Over the last 6 or so months I can feel a familiar darkness coming back and see the signs of where my brain/body is headed. A lot of what I feel is work related. 

In my 3 years the company is different and not at all a company I would choose now. I started with a cohort of 10 others who were also bootcamp grads and we did a 6 month consulting program to get started with the company. I started in front end development, but a year into my time here I made a leap over to data analysis/engineering (I’ve done work in both). I self taught myself power bi so that I could be eligible to be placed on data related projects. I’ve spent the last three years bouncing from client to client, environment to environment and I’ve hit a wall. My brain has been drinking from a fire hose with what I’ve been learning since the start of 2021 and because the clients/environments/tools changing every 2-3 months I’m 1. feeling so unbelievably tired from being in a constant mental state of “uphill” learning with no “downhill” time and 2. Feel like I am 3 years in and while I’m familiar with a huge array of tools/environments/tech stacks, I have no solid footing in any area or really even in a given tech stack. I really underestimated how stupid I would feel all the time in this field and how heavy that would weigh on me. 

At the end of last year our company took away our unlimited PTO in exchange for 1.5 weeks the first half of the year and 1.5 the second, as they are making a heavy heavy push for us to be billable to clients. We’ve done 4 rounds of layoffs and while I’m shocked I’ve never been let go, everyone is on edge. I’ve been very sick/lost a family member this year and didn’t take time off due to not hitting my utilization and fearful. Of the 11 in my cohort, only 3 of us are left which makes me feel ick. We also started a program specifically meant to hire women returning to the workforce after time away (mostly mothers) then months later laid them off. 

Truthfully the moment our unlimited PTO was taken away I knew I would be looking for other work, but as many of you know and I see you dealing with, the market is in the toilet. All of this and more has really left me questioning if I made a mistake and where to go from here. I’m so so drained from taking in such a variety of technical skills in the last 3 years that some days I really feel like I am not cut out for this world at all. I’ve looked at transitioning to something still in tech but less technical, project or product management. Then sometimes I think if I could just get out of consulting and have a focus, I’d love that, but then with the turnover of projects I feel like I am not solidly marketable in an already harsh job market and not even sure about applying for analysis or engineering roles. 

My serious brain fog and overall life fatigue barely gives me energy to finish the work tasks I’m being given and I’m constantly down on myself for how long it takes me to complete them. By the end of the workday I can’t manage reworking my resume or looking at jobs or any task that is not just disassociating. I feel overworked, underpaid, undervalued, overlooked and burnt out. I brought this up to my manager months ago and while he’s kind, his one suggestion was to take breaks during the day. With how our company pushes utilization, no one has the time to invest in each other/ourselves and I’m drowning. 

I really don’t know what to do or where to go from here. I just know I need to try something before I go flying off this cliff I see myself barreling towards. 

I’ve been lurking the posts here for a minute and I’m sad that a lot of us feel the mental weight. I feel for everyone who’s been laid off and looking for so long. Not that anyone has a golden answer for me, but I have seen a lot of help and kindness doled out here too and even if someone has one little nugget of wisdom, or insight, or an “I’ve been there too” it is all greatly appreciated. 

Please look after yourselves as much as possible. Lots of love. ",user_503,28,19

I went to a solid CS program, have a few 'fancier' companies under my belt. Not FAANG but still have industry reputations.  There's a lot about the job I like. I love the feeling of building something up from nothing and having it work. I love the balance of independence and teamwork. Ever since I was a girl I always thought I'd be an engineer of some kind so its awesome to be living that dream.   
  
Here's the problem: I think I'm too slow.  
  
 It's always a few things. I'm not super detail oriented. Not for lack of trying, my brain just loses track of things. I'll forget to remove print statements or old imports. I'll forget to copy over a requirement onto my todo list and have to go back and unwind some implementation. I don't do all of this every time, but something almost always comes up.  
  
 Then once I put up my PR,  I always get a \_deluge\_ of comments. Some of them are reminders about those print statements or imports. But just as many are just suggestions for how I could implement things differently, rename a variable, break things out of a file or put them in the same file.   
  
Even though they're just different approaches, I end up burning time debating with other engineers about these approaches, and usually just get tired and do it.  I get 2 or 3 rounds of those which I have to go back and fix. And while I'm making those changes, I have to keep merging with the changes other engineers make which takes even more time. This is while those same engineers will leave half as many comments on each others work and ""approve to unblock"".  
  
Sometimes I spend just as much time in the PR review as I do working on the task itself. I try to work on things in parallel but when things depend on each other, those  dense rounds of feedback become adjustments I have to make both in the reviewed work and my work in progress.  All of this becomes frustrating when I'm trying to show that I'm not slow.   
  
The thing is I know I'm getting better. I know I'm faster with these skills  as I develop. But then I have to pick up new skills / work in a new area and I'm slow there again and it just cycles. 

I recently left a job with a pretty rough manager who used to ride me for how many days and hours my work took. My other engineering friends said they were setting unrealistic expectations, and possibly discriminatory, but I did compare my PR history to other eng on my team and I did just have less submitted than others. Not hugely less, but definitely less. I'm not sure if this manager has gotten inside my head, even now that I'm at a new place, but I still can't help but wonder if they're right. 

I have over 4 YOE, so I keep wondering, is this normal? are there some engineers that are just doomed to be too slow? Not sure if this is me just not being good at the job or if this is the pipeline at work trying to push me out. In all of the contexts above, I was the only woman on the team or project. But that doesn't spare me from just not being good at it... right?

Would love a sanity check or suggestions if you have them.",user_504,28,9

He tries to blame me for things that my team messes up or he messes up. I always have to clean after them. Recently he tried to sow discord between me and another team. Trying to make me admit that I was working with other teams to screw over my own team. Which I didn't do.

He also did other things, that caused my cptsd to be triggered. Now it is linked to him. He knows this and will purposely put pressure on me during meetings with or without the team.

**I document everything and the job market is rough. I have been trying to look for a new job as well as upskill as much as I can. I unfortunately, can't go on without this job. I've also taken FMLA and PTO. I've gone to therapy but can't afford it anymore.**

**HR and his boss is also aware. They are all on his side. Told me I am playing the victim and paranoid.**

**Good thing is we are remote. Bad thing is I can't leave meetings when I feel like I am in danger because he takes it to HR and HR says I am disrespectful. I've had full on panic and anxiety attacks in meetings that I could not leave.**

**I do not want to involve lawyers. I can't afford it financially or mentally.**

My main question is, how do you control your emotions?

Any tips on adopting a idgaf attitude? How to control my emotions so I don't fall into his traps?

How do you control your urge to respond and to justify yourself?

What to do when he makes shady comments?

What should I do to protect myself from the difference in expectations and responses to me vs the team?

How to take back the control of my emotions?

I would appreciate any tips! Books, videos, etc. Anything!",user_198,27,35

Before I left I was a software developer.

I'm struggling to figure out where to even begin. I haven't done anything software related in the 3 years I've been out of work. I've heard of returnships; however, the area in which I live does not have any companies offering one nor can I move out of the area. I also haven't really had any luck finding anything remote for a returnship either. I'm not sure if that is because my timing is bad or because they are simply not offered. I also do not have the means to afford taking classes/getting a certificate at the moment.

Do I just apply, apply, apply and hope that someone takes a chance on me? Are there any hiring managers out there that can give advice on what they look for when someone has taken a career break or am I simply doomed to having my resume be thrown out?",user_507,29,24

Summary: I can't tell if comments I'm receiving are highlighting legitimate areas of improvement I can make, or if I'm just operating in a misogynistic system. 

---

Environment: I work in a design department at a small, privately owned tech company.

Context: My higher-up recently quit, and I inherented some responsibilities from him. One of which is giving product demos on sales calls. Three separate colleagues on three separate occasions openly told me and told others that they wish they could have gotten someone else to do this. My boss just came to my desk to tell me that I'm bubbly and artsy and that on sales calls I should be more relaxed and confident.

Extended context: I am relaxed, and I am confident. But I guess it doesn't come across that way. This ""bubbly and artsy"" comment has been made about me, directly at me, by other male coworkers. I understand it's a compliment but it's very annoying and I feel like I'm being treated like a baby. I am aware that I am polite, friendly, and helpful in the workplace. But I guess that comes across as being a manic pixie dream girl.

Actions already taken: for this specific situation, I'm approaching relevant colleagues to practice giving a product demos to them. 

More actions I've taken:
- I've removed all decorations from my cube and only have a few pictures up of family. - I rarely wear makeup. 
- I dress like an adult and try to eliminate ""zoomer fashion"" whenever possible.
- I execute tasks in a timely manner and I contribute beyond my role whenever possible.
- I'm working on my portfolio to begin applying for new jobs.


Other than that I'm not sure what else I can do. 

Side note: My husband doesn't think it's  a misogynistic issue, he just thinks the company is full of condecending higher ups towards all genders. We have the same job at different companies. He also acts friendly and helpful like I do. He works on a design team of mostly women, so he thinks that misogyny is gone and that girl bossing is like the norm. Is he right? I don't know. I've never seen men on the same level as me get constantly told that they're bubbly and artsy.",user_49,27,19
1gbzcko,2024-10-25 17:10:01 ,womenintech,https://www.reddit.com/r/womenintech/comments/1gbzcko/refusal_to_adopt_or_even_collaborate/,Refusal to Adopt or Even Collaborate,"I recently read an article, ""Why the gender gap in physics has been stable for more than a century""  [https://phys.org/news/2024-09-gender-gap-physics-stable-century.html](https://phys.org/news/2024-09-gender-gap-physics-stable-century.html), about a research paper titled ""Emergence of group size disparity in growing networks with adoption"": about how the number of women in Physics has not changed within the last 100 years! What is new to me is that they narrowed down the breakdown mechanism to equality to not getting adopted into networks or ""Refusal to collaborate"" as the main reason. As opposed to other articles that put the breakdown mechanism being put under the broad brush of bias, I like how it pinpointed the exact pivotal moment through data models. Pinpointing that mechanism was just an ""Aha!"" moment for me. Yes! Failure to adopt and the first instance of refusal to collaborate are key indicators on how bright someone's future is when entering a field.  

I'm sure all of us on here have had these encounters, at the time of the occurrence some brainstorming as to the reason; personality compatibility issues; bias towards sexism, racism, ageism; or some kind of general insecurity on the offending agent.  All of the reasons being unsatisfactory and unhelpful for my situation. If I think back on when i received the first sign of refusal to collaborate and then how my relationship with those entities turned out, the correlation of that negative outcome to the refusal to collaborate indicator holds true, That isn't to say that I didn't find a way to succeed in my field, but my path to success definitely did not include working with them. 

Below are some of my examples of ""Refusal to collaborate/adopt""  instances:

*  When I was an individual contributor as a subject matter expert, the Team Lead would ask someone else a question relating to my subject matter, then the team lead would be told  that they should talk to me, and the Team lead never did. This happened multiple times.
* As a Team Lead, I've had the Technical Lead at the beginning of a project tell me, ""I don't think I need a team lead"" and then proceed to contacting others to perform my role. 
* Another example is being told by the Project lead at the end of meeting, ""By the way, we took an asset from your project"" and I was left to find my own solution so that my project was not behind schedule. This one had MANY bad indicators before this particular example and was particularly traumatic for me and my other female coworkers to try to persist working there. 

Lots of descriptive words of those encounters come to mind; but ""Refusal to Collaborate"" is a short and less profane way of summing it up.  I would suggest to any new onboarder to take note of signs of refusal to adopt and immediately try to find a way to work on a solution to that situation. 

**The question is how to handle it? Work around it or Work through it?** 

My attempts to work through it include asking advice from multiple functional managers but they write it off as personality incompatibility, a shrug, or acknowledging the issue as a truth but then add a ""Nothing will change"" conclusion. My attempts to work around it include avoidance of that person, or as in more often the case, them avoiding me since they are higher ranking than I am. They can choose to ask me questions, but it doesn't affect my work if they don't. Even in status meetings, they didn't ask me questions. They were very strange status meetings. In the case of the lead taking over my position, I have done both the above options; talked to my functional and program leadership and then concluded that it was heading to the ""nothing will change"" conclusion,  I avoided working with that person by leaving the program and going somewhere I was wanted.  

**What is the Solution?**

The article and study conclusion does not put the solution onus on the victim. It puts the solution on the system to create collaborative opportunities between men and women.  To me, that means people managers and leaders.. and so we are back where it started. The ones that create the problem are the ones that create the solution. 

I think for my specific situations, I would have liked it if management:

* instead of the shrugs and ""Nothing will come of it"" talk, there was actually actions to confront the behavior. Regardless if the outcome is nothing, just the act of ""Trying"" would make a lot of difference to me. In one case, I went to the EEOC and just hearing them say that they would take my case on despite them also saying that ""nothing would  likely come out of it"" just made the world of difference. I knew that my point of view of validated and that there was SOMEONE who was willing to fight with me. 
* In the cafe of the Team lead who just refused to ask me questions. Program and Functional Management was being told of issues, but was content on getting one-sided information (I was unaware) and then just came down on me even though I was the subordinate and the Team Lead was the one avoiding me. They should have sat us both down and just hashed out the issues that I was unaware of what was happening. Or went through our functional managers since they might be more trained on personnel issues. I was only aware of the final escalation of the ""refusal to collaborate"" activity.
* In general, anyone who leads or manages people need to be aware of the critical time of onboarding and integrating people onto a team. People need to talk to Subject Matter Experts on their Subject Matter no matter what because that is their job. If you put someone in a role, then you should support that person in that role until it becomes obvious that they cannot perform that role. 

Choosing emotionally intelligent leaders who are open to adoption of new people and are committed to creating a collaborative environment is key. I know what to look for now to ensure that I am in environment that allows me to grow, I hope that everyone can look out for the warning signs so that they can work out a solution to growth as well. It's tough still being the only woman in the room, but I'm glad we have a forum to support each other.

PS I also hope that everyone votes!",user_509,27,3

I can’t change jobs now, as I am in the process of buying a house.

I wanted to give an update and ask for more advice as it’s been a couple days and after asking around I have a better understanding of what to expect.  

I mentioned it to my senior manager and he said this VP has done a session like this a few months ago where all the women were invited from another building and that was sort of a q&a type thing as part of his diversity&inclusion initiative. I hadn’t heard of this initiative before but I guess he’s recently been trying to advocate for it.  

Fortunately, the timing of the previous session indicates that this initiative is unrelated to the ongoing gender discrimination lawsuit at another company under our parent company. It really does seem like it’s just a poorly communicated effort to get to know some of the female employees and maybe due to the election and other company politics I’ve experienced I was a little too quick to judge.  

So, my follow up question is this: how can I prepare for the session and how should I present myself there? It will just be the VP and a pretty small group maybe a dozen or so ladies, and I only know 2 of them personally so I’m feeling a little nervous to make sure I give off a good impression.

(usually more senior) we'll get back to you.""

I guess my question is: Did they ever get back to you, or is that just a polite way of saying 'no, you suck, don't ever call us again'?

I don't know what to do anymore. I used to nail interviews. I used to get every job once I got an interview.

I even run a blog showing my self started projects in cybersecurity. I’m not sure if these feelings are based out of fear because I heard many stories of women being discriminated, or me just not believing in myself a lot.

I work remotely so it’s not like people see me in person. I do present very femininely and I understand how that can be a hinderance. I can’t help how I am. I feel like I need to present myself as a man more if I want to be respected. Now that im job hunting, I’m feeling the weight of being rejected from jobs. I’m also fairly young, 25.

These feelings are eating at me. I end each day at work feeling defeated. I’m doing all I can to get out of my crappy work situation but it just seems so impossible.I made the decision to get into a male dominated field so I feel like I should just grow up and deal with it.

I feel like I don’t belong in the industry because I’m not what’s expected of a cybersecurity professional. I have been put in rather uncomfortable situations at my job that I feel would not have happened if I presented myself differently. Sometimes I really wish I was a man. I wish I wasn’t so feminine. 

I don’t know what to do 😔

Among 300+ attendees, I found maybe 5 women.

There was even a talk about Enhancing Diversity for a Stronger Kubernetes Community. Maybe ironically enough, I didn't attend that one because I was more interested in the more technical alternative.

   I managed to get couple job offers but declined them both. Latest was Systems engineer and although I don’t mind helping configuring and troubleshooting repos, systems and package managers, it’s not something I’d enjoy doing full time. 

   During one of my latest job interviews,  the devops engineers evaluated my devops skills as “junior” level. That made me think about my skills, but didn’t make me question them. I know there’s always something to learn. 

  The other day I read several comments on r/devops saying that devops is not a junior level position at all and in fact requires years of experience in admin, networking, OS.  That there are some skills that everyone can pick up easy but that doesn’t mean you are devops professional. 

   That’s when it hit me that maybe it is me indeed.   
   Maybe that’s what I did, I just picked up “the easy” skills as that person said. Then my former manager lied to me when he said we are building the first devops team. 
    Instead of looking for other jobs I stayed in this “devops” team. Senior engineers started leaving.   
     I got opportunity to learn so I did. I put countless of hours learning Ansible,tfs, ado, gitlab, package managers, docker, k8s. 
   I was admin and help desk and helped SEs much smarter than me with their helm chart issues; wrote Python and bash scripts.  

   But now I begin to wonder what experience has all this work given me? 

  Obviously I can’t apply for devops jobs, then what am I?

   What jobs does my work experience qualify me for especially in this market. 
 What have I been doing all this work for? 

I don’t even know what jobs to search for at this point with my experience - I just know how to use bunch of automation tools -yay.  I’m kind of stuck in a very slow moving place and since I don’t work for faang company getting a new job might take who knows how long. 
   Even if I earn cloud certs and terraform certs, that still won’t be enough because for devops job the general requirement is 2 to 4 years of practical experience. 

   I hope this is not just my monologue but if it is, well at least it felt better just writing it here. ",user_524,26,17

Was I rude?,"When I was in my 2.5 year at a unicorn tech company (first job out of college), I had so many interviews on my plate. The company really espoused the point of being “good to women” so specifically pooled female/diversity engineers to interview female/diversity candidates. Not all interviewers would be female, ofc, but at least 40%. This was all a show, but even I had fallen for it - it was a key reason why joined the company in the first place.

Anyhow, I was the final interviewer for a female candidate. And she kinda blooped it. None of the test cases passed. Honestly, the vibe I got was that she didn’t care as she didn’t think I was an important interviewer (I think she did well all her previous rounds). Anyway, I gave her a “No.”

And then we had the Zoom call with several other interviewers to decide, and I was the only “no.” The hiring manager seemed to really like the candidate and have some sort of personal connection to her (for context, I’m Asian, candidate is white, hiring manager was a brown woman.)

What kinda icked me was the room really tried to disqualify my opinion somehow. The hiring manager asked how many times I’ve asked this interview question. (As if to suggest I’m the unqualified interviewer). And I said, assertively but non-aggressively (I swear!): “I’ve asked this question in interviews more than 20 times, and if we were to disqualify interviewers’ opinion like this, why bother having them in the first place?”

Yes. I was being assertive. And I know everyone tell women in tech to be more assertive. What they don’t tell you is the repercussions of being assertive:

- The entire room went silent, and the hiring manager glared at me 

- The candidate got an offer. Our company has a culture of all the interviewers chiming in on the offer call to say congrats - but I wasn’t invited.

- Our office was doing flex WFH, and when I met the hiring manager in the office, I dropped to say hi. I didn’t think she’d be below holding grudges at me for dissent. But she saw me with the utmost hate in her face, barked “oh hi”, and switched her seat to be far away from me. 

Was I the asshole? Looking back, I think the best response seems: “Maybe she was just tired after a long day. It looks like she did well in all her other interviews.” — this way, I hold my ground without offending anyone in the room.",user_258,24,16

Struggling to move past interaction with former toxic manager this week,"Hey ladies. I’m having a hard time moving on from something that happened this week with my former manager….I would love any advice you could share on how to reframe this situation 

Some background is that a couple years ago the manager of our team got demoted. Her strength is tactical management, but when it came to people management, especially working with anyone who is different than her, things just fell apart. She enabled bullies, pitted people against each other, and scapegoated people. It took some time, but eventually the director above her caught on to what was going on, and they made changes. We now have another manager (who’s great!), but we still have to deal with our former manager in larger meeting settings. 

I’ve been working on something for several years and we finally took some big steps in the project. I was excited…but sure enough, as we’re reviewing the progress in a meeting, she chimes in with a passive aggressive comment that could have passed as supportive if you didn’t know the past history, but there was an underlying dig thrown in that related to one of the main ways she used to throw people under the bus. I know it’s one of those moments where I just have to say to myself, “forget about it and move on,” but it really took the wind out of my sails. 

It’s like, after everything that happened to you, they took your team away from you, and you STILL find it within yourself to poke at people?? What is it going to take for you to change?

I’ve dealt with much worse when it comes to her in the past, and I don’t know if it’s just my lizard brain kicking in, but I guess I find it a little…scary?…that she still either a)lacks the self control to stop herself from commenting or b)still thinks there’s nothing wrong with her actions.

If you’ve come across situations like this before, what reframes have helped you pick yourself back up and keep going? So far I’ve been trying to tell myself “hurt people hurt other people“ and “the only thing I can control is myself.”

I'm overwhelmed.","Hey all, this is a rant/stream of consciousness about work happenings. Not sure if I want sympathy or advice (open to receiving both), mainly want to get this off my chest.

I'm a software engineer (\~3 YOE) and I've been at my current company for a little over a year. At first, it was pretty incredible: fully remote, letting me travel abroad long-term with my laptop and working from some really cool destinations, working with other women developers for the first time, completing projects in months instead of years. This tech startup of around 100 people was so different from a previous corporate environment where I was a happy but otherwise mindless cog in the machine.

Then leadership changes and a different company focus have meant the dream travel policy was reduced to a standard 3 months per year and more recently, a large cut to our engineering headcount in favor of bringing in contracted teams. In the cut, my engineering manager and a teammate were let go. I'm back to being the only woman on the team, and our team will be half its original size at the end of the month due to restructuring. Morale is pretty low.

The cut coincides with the start of a new, rather complex project on our team, the first one I'm leading as a sort-of project manager. (Different developers on our team take wear the project management hat for different projects, and this is my first time doing so, both at this company and in my career). I'm thankfully pairing on the project management with another person, but with our manager gone, we've had to step up and fill in bigger shoes than expected to get everything kicked off and loop all of our stakeholders in. Additionally, this project is meant to fix a defect that's losing us customers, so there's a *ton* of scrutiny from executive leadership. Our interim manager, hopping in from managing another team, has mentioned different ideas to move up the expected code-completion date (clearing our plate of any other projects and ad-hoc tasks, cutting out meetings and processes, even working overtime with the promise of extra PTO post-project to compensate). Edit - this is highly unusual for this company and reflects the intense pressure from leadership. 

I will say that everyone involved in this process wants things to go well for the people on my team. I've been asked by execs if we need more people or other resources (can't accept this right away because the early project work is more sequential than parallelizable). Our interim manager has said if we work overtime, they'll be online with us. That they recognize how crazy all of this sounds. And we are expecting a new engineering manager in a few weeks, someone our interim manager has spoken pretty highly of.

I'm overwhelmed by it all. Losing people I liked working with, operating without a dedicated manager, tackling the plan for this complex project (hard enough on its own) with all the scrutiny, the possibility of working overtime. And outside of my engineering team, I've become a stand-in leader for our small women in tech group because the previous lead was let go in the engineering cut, a responsibility I still need to delegate to someone else because I know I'm past my bandwidth. I'm used to feeling like I don't know what I'm doing (a universal experience), but it's gotten much harder with so many constraints at once.

For now, I'm going to take it a week at a time. I don't really know what else I can do.",user_513,22,14

I (21 female) recently started as an AI Research intern, just two weeks ago. My team consists of one male manager, one male engineer, and three other interns— all male—who began their work a month before me. I started late due to HR issues, and now I'm supposed to work closely with one of the male interns who shares the same cultural background as me, basically we are on the same project. To clarify, I’m not generalizing, but I’ve noticed that men from my culture can often be toxic in both professional and personal settings. Unfortunately, my collaborator is no exception. Here’s what I’ve encountered so far:

1. Insensitive Remarks: He made fun of me for carrying pepper spray, even though we’re in a city with a high crime rate.

2. Undermining My Experience:When I shared a personal safety concern, he dismissed it by saying, “It happens to young men too,” completely disregarding the specific challenges women face.

3. Disrespecting My Time: He’s been late to every single one of our 1:1 meetings, showing zero respect for my time.

4. Misleading and Misguiding: He’s given me incorrect information multiple times, which has caused setbacks in my work.

5. Lies and Manipulation: He lies about his contributions during meetings with our manager, taking credit for work he hasn’t done. Rather claiming that he has started something, when confronted 1:1, he is like oh I haven't done that, is that what X (our manager was asking about)

6. Talking Over Me: He constantly interrupts and talks over me in meetings, making it difficult for me to contribute.

7. Stealing My Ideas:He asks questions in meetings that I’ve already discussed with him in private, as if they were his original thoughts.

8. Inappropriate “Jokes”: When I mentioned I was attending a baking workshop, he joked that I might poison everyone and eliminate the competition. I believe collaboration should never be seen as a competition, but he seems to think otherwise.

9. Incompetence: His coding practices are awful—he crammed 710 lines of code into a single Jupyter notebook cell with no encapsulation, classes, error handling or debugging capabilities. It’s clear he used ChatGPT to generate A LOT (All) of it.

10. Two-Faced Behavior:He behaves differently when our manager is around, pretending to be competent and cooperative, but reverts to being passive-aggressive when it’s just us.

11. Undermining My Work:Whenever I ask him for help, he either gives vague answers or promises to explain later but never follows through.

There’s a lot more to my toxic collaborator than I initially mentioned. Unfortunately, this isn’t my first time dealing with a difficult coworker, but this guy goes beyond being just an asshole—his intentions are downright malicious, and he’s far from a decent collaborator. The biggest issue is that my work depends on building on top of his code, which is so unstable that it’s nearly impossible to do my job effectively. My manager isn’t helpful either; he even joked that the only reason my collaborator was hired is that they’re from the same city/state, which is incredibly frustrating.

I need this internship to turn into a return offer, but I’m at a loss for how to deal with this situation. It feels like I’m being excluded from conversations and set up to fail. In the corporate world, it seems like you’re rewarded more for appearing busy than for the substance of your work.

How can I navigate this toxic dynamic and ensure I can still succeed in this internship? Any advice would be appreciated.

However, in this new company, I wear multiple hats and do many random little things vs having an established work MO. My manager has a similar situation. When I just joined everybody made fun about how he NEVER reads his emails, I laughed and thought it was an exaggeration.

Weeks later I noticed it was not, he sometimes doesn't check Teams messages, NEVER goes through his emails, forgets about things that happened even on the same day, and overall I find myself having to remind him things like a kindergarten teacher. 

Unfortunately, I have to work closely with him because he runs the whole department.

During meetings, he seems to not be fully self-reliant and stops to ask me to confirm several things: ""Right, Ana (my  name)?"", ""Ana will verify"", ""Ana"" this and ""Ana"" that. It drives me crazy.

In my previous job, my manager was older than my current manager but way sharper, and didn't need me to remind him about his work tasks all the time. He would complete his job duties and delegate whatever he needed to me.

I'd like to know if anybody has had an experience like this and if this is normal and I'm just being intolerant/ungrateful. TIA",user_534,24,6

I have a manager, and a tech lead. The tech lead assigns tasks to everyone. 
I am a F(27) working as an engineer, fairly new to the team. I was working remotely for a year, and my office asked me to move to the location. Last year as agreed I moved. The move was really traumatising for me as I moved states, both mentally, and physically, as I did everything alone. During that period, I did some mistakes at work. I talked to my manager, and he understood. The tech lead kept torturing me by saying mean things like you don’t know this, you are making so many mistakes, started micromanaging me, by asking me what time I log in what time I log out, and he wanted to see my time. I shared my problems with the lead as well. I never went through such situation at work ever, but the lead kept on saying stuff. I didn’t say anything to my manager as I didn’t know what to do. 
Fast forward 7 months, I improved myself, at work. Still the lead says mean stuff to me, every chance he gets, belittles me. Now I don’t usually go to that lead to ask anything I talk to my manager for questions, or my colleagues, but if I have to ask him anything, he says you don’t know this? You don’t know that?, and asks me to recall a year ago conversation I told you this at that time do you not remember that? 

My manager believes in me, and considers me that I can take up good tasks. But whenever the lead gets to know about it, he tries to interfere, and snatch my work, and tries if he can work on it. 

When I’m in the office, he treats me differently. Even though I do good, always try to see if he can find anything and criticises me. And even though some times for tasks we don’t know the exact path, we try to do it by ourselves. Some of my colleagues come to me to ask, whatever I do they copy. He criticises me if it’s not according to how he wants it to be, and doesn’t say anything to anyone. 

Sometimes when I’m working from office, and I  cannot complete my hours for the day, I log in from home just to finish the work that I took. He tries to micromanage and ask what were you doing at that time I saw you log in. 

Can anyone please guide me what I should do? ",user_536,24,11

It took us a very long time to find any candidates at all, and at the time and still today it feels like we were forced to settle on the manager we ended up with.

My manager, let’s call him Joey, comes from a non-technical background but had about 1 year of project management experience before joining us.

Coming from a non-technical background, I expected that there would be some sort of leaning curve as he learned our systems and learned how things worked, but more than a year later and he is still just as clueless as he was on day one and it doesn’t feel like he’s actually made any effort to learn either. 

I don’t think he knows anything about what we actually do. He’s a buzzwords guy and a yes man, so he often over promises to clients before ever even discussing the efforts with our team. He never says no so we constantly have new surprise items added to our sprints. Everything from him is “critical” because he wants to be seen delivering product to any and everyone as quickly as possible.

Other small gripes, but as a team we have asked him for collaborative sprint planning, and other meetings, which he has agreed to do, but has never scheduled. He will very often cancel our meetings last minute and call us at random times to remind us who is on call for that weekend.

My biggest frustration though is that I don’t get any actual leadership from him. He’s just a guy who tells me what efforts to work on. I can’t go to him with anything technical and everyone else on the team is usually equally buried in work so it’s just frustrating all around. 

Our previous manager came from a software engineering background and I could go to him with anything, and he was the one who did our code reviews as well. I haven’t had my code looked at or reviewed in more than a year now and I feel like I’m not growing as an engineer as much as I would like.

I feel like I’m at the end of my rope with the lack of follow through from him and the lack of leadership.

I’m half way ranting but I also could really use some advice on how to navigate work having a manager like this. At what point do I bring these concerns up with my Director? I don’t want to be seen a whiner, and I know it could be worse, but Joey is a manger in title only and it’s just really grating on me lately.",user_539,25,10

I’m seeking any advice anyone is willing to give in this situation because I’m suffering with so much anxiety and sadness. Is there still a point in following up next week? Is there anything else I could do before trying to move on and get back on the job hunting path? Should I just try to accept this and completely move on?

One of my key duties is to create user stories. As an organization we have been trying to move to an agile approach and user stories in general are a fairly new concept for us. 

My understanding is that agile is supposed to be incremental and iterative vs waterfall being linear and sequential. Where I struggle with this in particular is my tendency to have most of the user stories drafted up prior to the refinement work with the IT developers. I always let the product owners know about the iterative approach and let them known that things likely will change as we go through the development process and that the initial user stories are just really good rough first drafts. But I am wondering if because I have a full set of inital user stories, draft database documentation, and often mockups that I have iterated through with the product owners is this actually waterfall?

Once I develop the user stories, database diagram, and often mockups, the next step is refinement with the IT developers. Then we incorporate the work into sprints with sprint review and retrospective. We update the initial user stories as needed through the process.

A few times, I have had a condensending male manager say that this isn't agile and it is waterfall.  He then spews the text books explanation of the two approaches. When I have pushed back and said where will we start with a project then? He simply says we will use agile to figure it out and doesn't provide any guidance on how to do things differently. 

Has anyone else experienced something like this? 

Is he right that I am doing waterfall, or is this actually agile, or is it a hybrid?",user_541,22,17

So, I was lucky to get a job interview with a top-tier e-commerce company. The job description was very vague, it said 'Project Manager' with a hint to Merchandising tasks but all other aspects matched my past job very well. So, I applied.

The screening and the hiring manager interviews went very well. However, now they sent me a case study (per the hiring manager -  they have just created this case study for the first time for this rather new role)

I am being asked to create an entire concept for not just one but 7 collecting categories (with subcategories Fashion...gloves, and hats), the presentation is supposed to be 30 minutes long.

I am freaking out now - I think there might be a misunderstanding here on my end and the recruiters' end about the role and my work experience. Or, it's vague to start with and the actual job might not even be what the case study is.

30 minutes - that is a ton of work that I would not mind doing but  I feel suddenly I am not the best match for this role.

How do I communicate that to the recruiter without burning bridges? They seemed so impressed with me during the interviews but now I am wondering how that case study fits into what we talked about. I feel like I applied for a job as a surgeon and now they are sending me a case study for a rocket scientist. Haha.

Should I  just be honest and say something like 'Thanks for the opportunity' but I realize that I might not be the perfect match based on the case study. I have worked in that area as a consultant and with a specialist weekly but I was not THE specialist.'

I could do the presentation but frankly, it would be a pain because it's not my main specialty and then I would possibly embarrass myself and possibly lose out on other opportunities with this company that I am much better suited for.

Ps - ranting but...  
I hate these case studies - I have done them before, last time wasted 3 days on 6 interviews and a case study which required a lot of research -  only to hear that they loved my resume, they were impressed with my presentation...but 'I should come back in 6 months and apply again.. and work on my 'STAR' method (Mckinsey ) presentation skills'.

I've seen people say that recruiters are looking for those with experience but without a job you can't even get experience, it's  a catch 22. What can I even do to make myself stand out? It's only been my mum and I and I want a good job so that we both can live comfortably and I can see her retire. She works very hard for me and I want to provide the both of us a good lifestyle.

I’m a snr software developer with 7 yoe at midsize startup feeling overly disempowered - a wage slave!? I’ve been at my current job for almost 4 years. It first burnt me out at 3 yr mark when I took a medical leave. I can’t put in words how I bad I was feeling back then- all sorts of lonely, depressing, tiring and self harm. 
After my break I felt much better and realized how meaningless all my work really is. I saw more clearly how senior leadership is just dangling a moving goal post, pushing their individual agendas through us being truly clueless. And through all that learning I’m now a different person. I no longer work long hours, let deadlines miss and many a time do not manage to show all of what the management is asking out of me - presentations, process changes, code, leading projects (all at once). 
Lately I’ve been pushed and pulled in all sorts of directions without much control. When I push back the management makes it seem like my problems are imaginary, even self inflicted. 
All this is making me feel like a slave wage with my inputs and problems not being heard at all. I can’t help but feel it’s all mental manipulation. I worry I might get laid off if I am not back at working more hours to somehow make it work. 
There is nothing keeping me at my current job other than tech job market being difficult and I’m already having less mental capacity to prepare.

I applied and am about to interview for another team at my company. I could give a slew of reasons as to why, but I’ll just say I’m one of the only women in my entire department and have dealt with some less than ideal misogynistic stakeholders in my current department and I’m just tired point blank. In addition to that, I’ve been in my role for about 1.5 years and have had stellar performance reviews (I am within the top 2 performers on the team).

My company’s internal policy is that you have to talk to your manager before applying to another internal role, so that’s what I did. He was supportive, but definitely upset. HIS boss had a 1:1 with me this week that left me in tears afterwards. He basically told me the team isn’t where it needs to be with me here etc etc. I asked him what his expectations are for the team and I got a run around answer (his communication is known to be lacking, confusing and he all around doesn’t have a track record of being the most pleasant person to talk to or work with). He basically said “good luck” for getting the other internal role in the most condescending way. There are other major red flag things I could include from the conversation, but I’ll keep it high level for my identity just in case haha. I talked to my manager after this and he expressed that he (his boss) was mad at me applying to the other role because he believes everyone should be in their roles 2-3 years before moving on. It doesn’t seem that anyone else on the team feels this way, except my boss’s boss. I’ll note he’s also a boomer.

It also seems like him (boss’s boss) and all the directors are talking about this (me applying to the other role) in their staff meetings, which I don’t love. I haven’t even interviewed for the other position yet!! And I might not even get offered it! I have no idea who else I’m up against or if the hiring manager for the other role will think I’m the best fit. IMO, it’s not anyone’s business right now except my boss, and his boss. 

My question is how long have you been in your role before internally moving on and how did the internal move work out for you if you moved? I’ll add to this that my boss’s boss (the jerk) has given my 2 new big dumpster fire projects within the past week (one project that literally has nothing to do with what I normally do, and shouldn’t even be led by my team). I feel like I’m getting punished for trying to further my career. 

I feel like this is not normal behavior and I should leave regardless of me getting the other internal role or not. Would love others perspectives as well!",user_560,21,9

I’m not sure who to talk to but I’m sure strangers are less scary than people who actually know me.

Things were going good. But I got laid off a few days before Christmas in 2023 and here I am still jobless in august 2024. My unemployment is almost up. I won’t be getting anymore checks after next week. That’s how long they gave me to be normal again. But still jobless and unhappy. I have a loving boyfriend but I feel like a burden at this point. I have anxiety as well and when I feel anxious about things I just get told my friends and family is to grow up. I wish I could just grow out of it. But it’s hard to even exist, It’s been getting harder and harder to go about my life but I just feel like a disappointment. I only have like 2 friends, I have no job, no community, no life, the only thing keeping me together is my dog and boyfriend but I can’t put all that pressure on them.

I'm still interviewing, so it's not like I'm comparing offers. The job I'm interviewing for turned out to be, to a T, what I DO NOT want (I know exactly what I don't want, not so much what I want). The job description looked like any other I applied to. The recruiter and HM interview went well - nicer than I expected, exciting projects coming up, etc. I then interviewed with two more people and the way they described what I will be doing, I almost broke down during the interview and had to pull myself together (Internally! took like 5 seconds lol). Not only that, but there were certain things that I noticed that making me feel anything but excited. I'm in NO position to be picky at this point. If I were to be offered the job, I will most likely accept it. I just would have to do a lot of mental work to not let it get to me.

These are the things I have noticed so far that I think are - not so good signs.

* **Lack of technical questions:** even though my job was going to be tech support, I was not asked a single technical question, not one - unless the yes or no question ""have you used this technology before"" counts as technical. All of them had to do with project management and behavioral questions.
* **Culture fit interviewer:** I was interviewed by someone who was not in HR nor the team I was going to join. They were not a technical person either. When I asked how come (because this was the first time I've seen it happen) - they said something like ""to see culture fit"". I don't know if this is a bad thing - but the way the interview went made me feel like they were looking for an extrovert.
* **Interviewer scheduled during their PTO**: A manager I interviewed with scheduled someone to interview me, knowing they were on PTO?? They ended up not showing up (good for them). They were scheduled to interview me along with the ""culture"" person (who said, ""yeah, so and so is good about not working on their PTO so they're probably not going to show up""). I waited till the end anyway, I didn't want to give them a reason to mark me down.
* **Not many questions asked in general:** The HM and another manager who interviewed me spent a lot of time stressing what my responsibilities were going to be and all challenges/problems they were facing;
* **Warm and fuzzy, close knit, small team:** I was asked what I thought about company events, organized fun activities, etc (by the culture fit interviewer). And the words ""warm and fuzzy"" were used by someone else who interviewed me lol. I'm an introvert - warm and fuzzy is not my style and company events make me want to retreat to the farthest and quietest corner.
* **Org structure and job titles:** The way the org was structured was like none that I've seen before. The titles were all over the place - they did not make any sense at all to me. They did mention there would be a reorg soon.

**The Good (if I were to be offered the job):**

* Job, income, employment, health insurance, purpose, not hiding from humans,
* Everyone I talked to sounded nice, no one interrupted me or made me feel stupid. Even though they spoke more than they asked me questions, it wasn't so much ""I like hearing myself talk"".

Has anyone else been receiving suspiciously low-quality recruitment calls for senior tech positions? I'm specifically referring to:

* Recruiters primarily from India with sometimes minimal English language skills
* Targeting jobs at major tech companies like Meta, eBay, and Etsy
* Senior-level positions with surprisingly low compensation
* Contractor roles with below-market rates

Some of the recruiters sound like they're from call center with aggressive requests to submit resumes immediately during the call and responding to their email to 'confirm' agreement with their terms so 'that they are allowed to forward my resume'.

I received a call from a recruiter for a Manager position at Meta being offered at $50k for an onsite role in a high-cost US location seems completely unrealistic. In major tech hubs, such a role would typically command $150-250k.

What is happening here? Is this recruitment scam, or outsourcing strategy gone wrong?

She is still not in a proper cognitive mindset so I have been texting her manager on her behalf to keep her posted. 

1. She has “unlimited” PTO - so should she continue to use that or go for short term disability (STD)? 
2. Her manager is worried and keeps asking what’s wrong even though I mentioned it’s personal. I do not want to share any details without her permission and I don’t think she’d want her manager to know. 
3. Her manager is also asking what customers she was working with so she can provide backup but I doubt my friend can give me a proper answer/list. 
4. This is a bonus non-work related question but she added myself and my hubby as her “after care planners” and we have a phone call tomorrow with her facility therapist. She stayed with me over the weekend before being admitted and it was unfortunately very, very taxing on both my husband and I.

What would you do in my situation? Stick with the current job for a few months until your maternity leave (consider quitting after) or just leave now?

I've started to realize that my boss, also the owner of the company, is unreasonable and does not respect my contribution in the workplace. Most of our conversations are him saying that he has seen a lot of issues in my work, but they are always for items / tasks that were never communicated to be my responsibility. I have been trying to protect myself from this by documenting all of his requests in Jira, but he does not pay attention to them. Anything he wants to push down to me, he will. 

For a little more context, I have 4 YOE as a data analyst and consultant. I quit that job because it was making me sick with stress. I used to work at this current company before I moved into the analyst role in a different, non-tech position, and they were happy to hire me back when I left. I wanted to put my new skills to use, so I asked my boss for the opportunity to work on the tech team. 

The tech environment here is rudimentary. There is no testing environment. I don't have any test data to work with, so I can't review my code before publishing it to production (YUP.). I have raised this as a concern several times. Yesterday I brought it up again as he was telling me that there were a bunch of issues (only one of which was 'mine', but again, would have caught it if I had the ability to review it), and he told me to ""not complain"".

Then as we kept looking through the app and clicking on a bunch of stuff to find more issues, I noticed something and mentioned it, and his reply: ""so you're logic must be wrong."" I guarantee you that he did not even review the logic (as he is front-end 50 minutes before the demo to the client, after I travelled all the way into the office the day before to make sure we were square and made a point of asking him if there was anything else that he needed me to do.), but I was tongue-tied from feeling attacked. 

I started crying because I felt shut down by him telling me not to complain and then he also said that he was ""not impressed"" with my work - how am I supposed to have a constructive discussion with this man? I told him through my tears that I have not been receiving clear instructions and that I am going to continue documenting his instructions in Jira so that we can make sure that we are aligned on his expectations. 

I am actively looking for new jobs. But does anyone have any advice for how to speak to someone who is this unreasonable? I guarantee you, if I had asked what the issue was with my logic, he would not know because he did not review it - so he would have turned it back on me and told me that I should know what is wrong with it. 

I honestly feel like he is threatened by me. I've seen that he does not have great coding skills, and he's too egotistical to admit that it isn't his wheelhouse. I don't feel seen as a valued contributor, just a pawn he wants to push around and intimidate. It's gross and embarrassing. But I feel like I am not cut out for tech in general if I can't hold in my tears while trying to deal with power-tripping dudes. 

My goal now is to document every detail, refer back to the Jira ticket, and ask him to sign off on them so that he can't just vaguely refer to my work as incomplete or undone. Does anyone have any other advice for a soft-spoken person dealing with a bully of a boss? ",user_578,21,10

I had quite a bad experience at a previous big tech company where I ended up being bullied pretty badly by a few of the guys on my team. Two of them were also hitting on me, and it ended up in a pretty dark place that left me quite shaken up. I ended up leaving the job, and have been unemployed for a while despite having a pretty decent resume, mostly because I've been scared that the next job could be just the same as the last. This was my first job in tech, and I was there for a few years.

  
Does anyone have any advice as I start to go through the interview process again about what to look for in terms of aiming for a healthy working environment, and avoiding this sort of situation again? I'm already a little bit on the spectrum so my baseline ability to get on with people is not necessarily top notch, and then throw in a hostile work environment and its very difficult to me. I don't want to leave the tech industry (and I'm not sure that I'm able to), though I might consider a pivot from software engineering to data science, since I've been to some degree at the intersection and get on a bit better with math people than software engineers.

Thanks in advance to anyone who has any advice or recommendations.",user_580,20,6

I went to a very competitive high school that truly had me believing I wasn’t smart. College was a lot kinder to me. I had some really great professors and mentors and had achievements I’m truly proud of to this day.The past seven years post college have been a bit of a rollercoaster. The first few years I was on a very supportive team. However, the team was quite senior and the work was very technical so the environment triggered my unresolved anxieties and lack of confidence from high school. After a few years of trying to power through I finally went to therapy. CBT tremendously improved my thought patterns and how I speak to myself.

Sadly during this time I also experienced two toxic environments, most recently at the start of this year. In both situations, my technical skills (or “technical leadership” as one Director put it) and my ability to learn new technologies were questioned.

I’m once again in a healthy environment, but I have noticed myself getting anxious when dealing with technical ambiguity or technologies I’ve never worked with (both of which there’s been a lot of in my new role). I never truly believe that I’m the best person to tackle it. While I know I can figure it out eventually, I never believe I’m doing things fast enough. I also believe my overall performance here hasn’t validated the “senior” in my title.

Unlike my early years in industry, I believe I’m smart and capable. I also believe I am a good human and loved regardless of my job performance. I just sometimes don’t believe I’m a good software engineer or capable of being one.

I genuinely want to feel like I’m excelling in my job. The fact that I keep trying makes me feel there’s some intrinsic belief that I can become good one of these days. But some days are *really* hard.",user_581,21,7

I am the only woman on my team  (which is less than 5 people) and the person with the most tech and working experience besides my manager. Ever since I have been working here I feel like I carry the burden for my coworkers lack of social skills and none of my coworkers takes me seriously. In the beginning, one of my coworkers with no professional tech experience shot down my advice in front of a big client when it actually ended up being correct and never apologized for it. I told my supervisor this and he acted like this was acceptable behavior.

Also on my team there’s issues with communication in that my male coworkers will talk among themselves about work but I’m never in the loop unless my manager says something or I barge into the conversation. My coworkers are pretty introverted but I feel excluded when they can talk to each other about WORK and not update me on the status. We also use an instant messaging system and most of my male coworkers hardly respond in a timely manner to me but they respond quickly to the other male coworkers. Our workload is much lighter than other companies so I honestly don’t understand why it takes over 30 mins to respond during down time.

And lastly, I’ve talked to my manager about it and he doesn’t see an issue with the above behavior. So because of this the poor social skills continue. I also feel like my tech skills have stagnated because I’m trying to keep my coworkers from offending or ostracizing our clients. 

It sucks because my male coworkers who don’t really know how to talk to people are getting technical projects while I’m getting nontechnical things. My professional achievements, personality, along with tech skills surpass my coworkers by a landslide. I’ve heard of the glue concept and realize I’m the glue and I don’t want to be.

Cut to this summer, I was feeling that my growth was stagnating so I interviewed and was offered another job at a competing firm. Important thing to note here is that while by competing I mean they are the same industry, but the new firm is an international firm with 1000 of employees worldwide. I was also offered a salary which was much higher (since I was being grossly underpaid in company A). 

I took up the job, and gave in my notice. I didn’t want to share the name of the new firm - but I was compelled to do so. That lead to my manager and the boss, screaming at me and threatening me, following which I left the very same day. I thought I’d put this behind me and just move on. Now they’re refusing to give me any experience letter etc, have also tried to jeopardise my new job by refusing to verify my employment in a background check process.

Out of the maybe 9 coworkers I have, I only have 1:1s with 3 of them biweekly. But my mentor (one of them) has continuously cancelled our 1:1s almost every week 😅

I think when I was still ramping up for the first 2 months he would be consistent and attend every week, but now he dismissively cancels at the last minute because he “doesn’t have anything to talk about”. We probably only meet once a month now, likely less than that. I think I’m doing pretty well and am efficient at unblocking myself, so maybe they think I don’t need them?

But as a result, I’ve been feeling out of the loop with the rest of the team. This person has also made jokingly sarcastic / disparaging remarks about younger people before at team lunches and during social events. This made me feel like I’m not really a part of the team, just an intern or something. The vibe he gives off is that doing a 1:1 with him is a very huge waste of his time which has made me wary of bringing it up.

There are also some career growth questions that come up more naturally during the course of a conversation w senior engineers, but now it feels like I can’t have those. Is this pretty normal for a jr dev at their first job? Or should I be pushing for more 1:1 time? I would be completely fine with once every 2-3 weeks as long as it’s consistent and I’m not constantly being cancelled on.",user_587,21,9

I recently accepted an offer with an outside company for a niche senior technical position. It moved extremely fast and I got a call about an offer (no numbers discussed) the day after the interview. 

We had 2 separate calls talking about if I want the job etc. During the benefits discussion HR never gave me a number and wanted me to give her a number. She wouldn’t tell me the range when I asked. Instead she told me to take some time after our call to think about a number.  I was prepared to ask for $145K-$150K before she emphasized the TC breakdown. 

I spoke with 2 people I knew at the company who had been there 10+ years. What I would’ve been happy with is $145-150K base salary, which one of the persons thought I was overshooting.  
Keep in mind I knew their salary would be lower since they started out as h1bs and had been with the same company for 10 years. Their compensation breakdown is better than mine because mine is heavier on bonus. 

The company had a posting of the range for a similar niche skillset and experience  ($180K-$200K OTE) which would be at least $145K salary. A different senior position in sales offered $200K+ OTE.  2024 H1B data shows they gave offers of $130-156K base. 

Even knowing this, I emailed her back later in the day asking for $135K, which was the bare minimum and less than $10K difference than what I’m making. 

What I had working for me:
- extremely niche skill set + years of experience 
- they’d been recruiting for this role for months and offered me the job right away (again they never gave or confirmed numbers)
- job referral
- VVHCOL 
- paying for my own schooling out of pocket

What messed with my head:
- the recruiter stressing the OTE (on target earnings aka total comp with salary + bonus)  and putting it back on me to give a number and not providing the budget or range or a number in the offer
- I had been thinking of quitting my current job. Severe depression and extreme anxiety due to work environment to the point I was having insomnia and breakdowns several days a week.  This had been happening for over a year but worsened the beginning of this year. And I’m not a quitter.
- assumptions the company is stingy 
- talking with someone who said I’m expecting too much despite having data from the company’s website
- flexible work environment, presumably less stress, better career path and title


Even with all this said and done, I know $135K is a great salary and this is a good career move for me. It just hurts that I didn’t ask for the $150K I really wanted and could have commanded - because I was trying to be considerate of the “total comp”.  I’m early 30s and it would’ve really made a difference in my life style and savings rate. I plan to stay with the company at least 3 years so that’s $45K I’m missing out on over that time + company matches. 

Has anyone else felt this way? Why am I feeling it this way? Why did I ask for the bare minimum?

Scenario: meeting with colleague A and B. Colleague A dismisses my input as “not the correct way to do things” and didn’t give me a chance to respond (of which I had a strong response) so left me there as dismissed and belittled. Afterwards colleague B made a post on slack which was my suggestion in this meeting but then tagged colleague A, another senior eng who I suggested he tagged, and wrote “others”, basically didn’t tag me of which I was equally involved in the discussion as colleague A. And due to this I missed out on meaningful contribution as once I found out about the post, they had already decided. Hence, excluding me from vital engineering discussion that I should have been a part of.

1- I am very comfortable in my current work and I want to do something more challenging . I want to switch jobs but how do I go about getting a high paying job in tech in this kind of industry now where layoffs are rampant. 

2- I think I have job security in my current company considering my work and how I have positive feedback from my boss is changing job a risk I should be taking ? 

3- I think I am pretty decent developer but don’t have much experience in System Design or Architecture level design. 

4- If I have to get a new high paying job what should I be doing, LC/System Design ?

I’m just needing to vent. Tomorrow is my last day at my first IT support job, and I’m feeling extremely defeated at the moment. I wish I could say I’m leaving for a more senior position or a better paying job. But I’m not, I’m leaving because of the toxic work environment that has destroyed my mental health. I do have a job lined up but it’s not IT and it pays less. It is remote which would help me move out of my current city to elsewhere (idk where yet).

 For a little background context, I do not have a degree in computer science or an IT background. I don’t have any IT certifications besides the Google IT support certificate. I was recruited for the role, and honestly I feel like they were looking for someone to take advantage of, and that’s exactly what happened. I make the least of my (all-male) team, get the least amount of vacation but out-perform and contribute by much more than anyone else including senior ranking individuals. I feel so defeated and I’m afraid once I get out of IT support that I’ll have a hard time getting back in. (staying is NOT an option)

My background is a mix of administrative, education, customer support (some of those roles requiring a lot tech skills and troubleshooting which helped me break into IT). 

Ugh I need to hear something to make the pain & fear go away. ",user_597,19,8

**Here is why I am asking -**  
I follow a company that I would fit in 300% - every detail about this place matches me, and my degrees. I even have two Master's degrees matching both columns of their branding, which are super niche in the industry. My experience, my network of clients, everything matches like a glove. I even match all of their additional qualifications and more -  I wrote my dissertation about the niche they are in. I know this industry and its players in and out. I graduated summa cum laude, and I have excellent referrals, in the industry, on LinkedIn, in person.

I am tempted to do an experiment and email the CEO directly and ask how I can get a foot into the door after I keep getting automated rejection emails saying 'that my skill set does not match'.

**Has anyone reached out to the CEO, and if so, what's your advice? What would you do differently? What was the outcome?**

**What are your thoughts on why HR filters perfect resumes**? Do we have to dim our lights to get an interview? Play dumb, get Botox for our resume basically, so we do look younger and more 'medicore' basically? In every interview that I did land, I was at least 7 years older than anyone else. And by 'anyone' I mean white men.

Here is my observation - I was the hiring manager in my previous job and I was stunned that HR would select resumes that had very little to do with the actual role and what I was looking for. BUT HR knew what I was looking for.  When I looked at applications, I found so many more suitable applicants that HR filtered out. Why is this happening, is HR filtering people out accidentally? Is it software that filters people out?  Is it bias? Is HR looking for good over excellent? 

If anyone can share their experiences, and also - what did you change?",user_49,19,20

2023 was such a weird and rough year for me, my company that I had just joined had layoffs. And then the new job I got last year, I absolutely hated. The company culture was too toxic, no work ethics and I was constantly stressed so I decided to quit after 3 months of working there. 

I thought I will take a bit of time off and look for jobs again this year, no biggie right?

After being laid off last year, I had no issues getting interviews and was also being reached out by recruiters. This year though, even after getting referred I am being rejected which has obviously spiked up my stress and anxiety. My brain constantly worries about what if I never get a job?

I love being an engineer and (my logical brain) knows I am a good engineer. Always worked with my head and heart and always ready to help people around me. 

Unfortunately, I have been getting really nervous and anxious during my tech interviews. Today was one of those days. I know I could have done so much better if I was relaxed but I just couldn't. 

Every time I bomb an interview because my anxiety came in the way, I feel so stupid and hopeless. And it gets me questioning whether I am even worthy of being an engineer.

A colleague and I are doing a talk on SOC and IR, and within that talk, we talk about the importance of communication, especially with other teams. This talk is to people going into cybersecurity specifically, but also tech in general (part of a series of talks). We've done this talk before with great success surrounding the communication section especially, but I got the approval to add a section on dealing with bias.



Being a woman in tech, I can speak from my perspective, but I am white and present as neurotypical, agnostic, sexuality-neutral, etc. Frankly, if you don't believe that bias exists in the industry, this talk isn't for you. I'm not trying to prove anything on that front. I'm doing a small slide on bias, but the focus of the content I'll be presenting is going to be skills and resources for dealing with bigotry and bias within the industry.



For example, my greatest advice for women in the industry is to be an active participant in your career progression. We are taught to make ourselves smaller and wait to receive what we deserve in due time, but the truth is that management forgets about the little guys, regardless of gender, and it is up to us to kickstart our career progression.



That being said, I would love to hear about the examples and skills/techniques you have learned over the years. I want to hear about your positive and negative experiences with those skills/techniques, what those experiences taught you, and your recommendations for others in the same situation.

","After 5+ months of diligently searching, and closer to a year of passive hunting, I finally received a new job offer. I'm still working through all the new hire background screening paperwork, so I'm not totally 'out of the woods' yet and still feeling nervous, but this also comes as a welcome relief. I've been in tech for eight years (and change). For the first eighteen months or so, I was at one of the FAANG companies, and for the past six years (and change), I've been at a large bank. Like many of you, I've experienced many similar challenges: being the only woman across several of the teams and projects I've been part of, blatant discrimination, grueling hours, the forced RTO -- even with extensive medical documentation on file regarding my immunocompromised status and mobility challenges regarding my autoimmune condition, toxic male egos, and more. 

Without going into substantial details (another post for another time), this new role comes as a welcome relief for various reasons, mainly in terms of quality of life improvements: much closer to home, fewer tax obligations, better QoL since I'll be able to sleep until 7am instead of waking up around 4:30am, and for the first time in my life, a boss that's a woman! My new commute will be only a 20ish minute metro ride, instead of a ~1-hour long train ride across state lines. My new role, while technically still across state lines, shares tax reciprocity with my residential state, whereas my current role is in a state that doesn't. For the pasy 6.5 years, in addition to paying federal and state taxes in the state I live in, I've also been obligated to pay taxes to the state I work in: $500 per MONTH to that state, multiplied by six years. The reduction in tax obligations alone will put an additional $500 per month back in my pocket. Additionally, my transit costs for the past 6.5 years have ranged (on average) from about $250-$400 per month, both when I drove and/or took the train. My new role = a different mass transit system which is much cheaper per ride, so there's another $200-$350/month back in my pocket also. 

I'll be honest: I'm feeling nervous. As crummy as the environment has gotten at my current workplace, it is what has become familiar. I've gotten comfortable. I know the culture, I know the job, I know the dynamics. It was/has been only my second ""big girl"" job out of school. I started there when I was young -- around the age of 23, and I just recently turned 30. I feel like I've grown up there. During my time there, I became a homeowner, got divorced, went through a major surgery for my autoimmune condition, saw significant turnover and churn in management, grew in ways I never could have even imagined, etc. I'm suddenly feeling like a fish out of water. This new role represents a significant leap in responsibilities and expectations, and so I'm feeling scared down to my bones. Is it normal to feel this way? Is this imposter syndrome just getting the best of me? 

My two most influential mentors, sadly, both passed away within the past (almost) two years, so I'm suddenly feeling very alone. By and large, over the past six years, I've been the youngest person on each of my teams by at least twenty years, and so unfortunately at least a handful of the mentors/role models I've worked with have passed away. Guess this is one of the sadder aspects of working in a multigenerational environment. Ordinarily, I'd turn to them for guidance, but alas, here we are. Any advice or insight is welcome.

So maybe I have AWS experience but they want GCP. Or must have extensive experience with python... for backend development. I have loads of experience with backend dev but using C#... I'm pretty good with python but used mainly for scripting and data manipulation. Or MUST have experience with dbt and I do, I learnt it for a coding challenge and became very proficient with no outside help but I've never used it in a job. 


Admittedly I'm something of a generalist, but why is it that we're constantly expected to demonstrate our knowledge of an ever changing set of technologies? I've done so much unpaid work trying to show I have specific skills. Do doctors have to do this? Lawyers? Accountants?

TLDR: I interviewed for a associate software engineering position at a government contracting company.  The next day the recruiter sent me a message saying the company wanted to hire me.  I filled out the pre offer paperwork and felt good about everything. Then a week goes by and I was told the company turned me down because they felt I couldn't get a security clearance or access to an SAP.  I have no idea what happened or why they felt that way as there's no obvious signs why I wouldn't be able to get either.

This happened recently and I'm honestly devastated by this.  For clarity I'm a trans woman who passes fairly well.  From voice to appearance to dress and how I hold myself.  This doesn't mean that I pass all the time and I've been called he in a few recent interviews.  Well, I heard back from a company that I applied to and was incredibly nervous as it is a company that focuses on government contracts for the military.  

Obviously, I very much felt like maybe once they saw me they would probably not even try and hire me as I have several piercings and look queer.  Well, as the interview goes on I feel more and more comfortable with the job and felt like I could work well in the environment. The very next day the recruiter that reached out initially said that the company wanted to hire me.  

Queue pre offer paperwork that took several hours and phone calls to prior employers to find the exact start and end date that they had on file.  There was one field that asked if I was let go from a prior job under difficult circumstances (worded differently) and I said yes.  I also put down my current legal name and prior dead name.  I do also have ADHD, but I got diagnosed after I applied to their company and updated the paperwork to reflect that change.

Well, I get a call from one of the recruiters.  He asked for my legal name and I said this is her.  Mind you my legal name is my chosen name.  He stated that I forgot to fill out the reasoning for why I left a prior company under not good circumstances. I marked down that one of my prior employers refused to enforce mask policy while I was working there.  It was a fast food place and none of the employees thought it required to wear a mask.  I quit the job as I didn't want to put my life at risk.  I realize now that I really shpuld have just put no as that event didn't actually match their requirements for the question.  

Cut to a week later and I was told that the company pulled back the offer because they felt I couldn't get a security clearance or an SAP.  I tried reaching out to see why they felt that way, but they haven't responded at all.  

My record is clean.  I don't do drugs.  I don't talk with anyone outside the US.  I'm on meds for ADHD.  I'm mentally well beyond that.  I should be able to pass every box for a security clearance.  I don't know what to do as the location I'm trying to live in has so many government contracting companies and all of them require some sort of security clearance.  I'm beyond confused and quite saddened.

Is this a case of the interviews saw me as a man and felt comfortable with a guy joining or maybe transphobia or Idk even know at this point.  I feel so incredibly defeated.",user_616,17,30
1gdrp9g,2024-10-28 02:20:51 ,womenintech,https://www.reddit.com/r/womenintech/comments/1gdrp9g/programmer_trapped_in_very_bad_situation_what/,Programmer trapped in very bad situation: What would you do if you were me?,"TL;DR: You were hired into a promising apprenticeship program at a well-known company but faced numerous challenges. You were thrust into complex work without adequate training, often excluded and undermined by male colleagues, and subjected to a hostile work environment. Despite your best efforts, you were constantly criticized and sabotaged. You were eventually moved to a new team where you excelled, but your success was short-lived. Your boss retaliated against you, falsely accusing you of poor performance and forcing you into an unsuitable role. You've experienced significant stress, health issues, and career setbacks due to this toxic work environment. You're now (see end of post for more details regarding options) considering several options: returning to work part-time, quitting entirely, or extending your leave. You're also contemplating disclosing a disability to potentially mitigate the impact of your past performance issues.

I (29-30F, United States of America) was hired through a 2 year degree holder community college apprentiship program at a very well known company as a programmer. I was promised on the job training, which was never provided (I have proof of this on email that they were to provide on the job training AND assuming no experince). This created a number of hurdles: being thrusted into very complex work that I honestly had no idea how to do, but I figured out along the way... but my skills were never 'up to par' with my peers, which created a number of hardships.

In addition, in my inital group I was the only female in a team of males. This was a non-issue for me, but the team lead for this group came up to my desk and said something rude on the first day. He then did whatever he could to make it seem like I was having performance issues, including assigning me a project to do which the chief engineers said point blank, would never be able to run on our systems. I spent 4 months doing this project day in and day out that would crash on every run due to memory issues, meanwhile eating shit from my supervisor that my performance isn't up to par because the project isn't getting done. Simultanously, I was excluded from the group activities/not acknowledged in the morning stand ups, had them offer a male employee help with his work in front of me while they never offered me any help at all... they just let me struggle with work they knew would never work. I had incidents, such as the team lead grabbing someone elses laptop out of their hands to send me rude messages on someone elses user account... happen on a regular basis.

After 4 months of this, my supervisor eventually 'wakes up' and realizes that I was in fact being sabbotaged. He moved me to another team within the same project, and I really excelled there within the first week - working on a challenging part of the code base and getting recongition from my peers!

I ended up being noticed by an exec who wanted to bring me onto their project, in another state. I booked a trip to explore this oppertunity and per policy my boss became aware I was travelling. My boss 'connected the dots' and the next thing I know my performance review was moved up to the next day (2 weeks ahead of when it should have been). I had a good review both verbally and on paper, I asked my boss what I could do in the next year to move up the next engineer level.... he flips shit, throws what is in his hands down on the table, I ended up being screamed at for 45 minutes, told I'm an incompetent and the exec and their team would never put up with my performance. He actually yelled at me “AND YOU THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS OK!?” … this was after the week prior saying I was performing  so well, we only needed to tag up every other month for check-ins.

Again - there was never any on the job training provided, and here I am, being harassed because I am not performing  well enough despite my review on paper being good - and being told verbally just a week ago that everything was fine - and I was never made aware of these performance complaints until this meeting. I brought the specific comments regarding feedback to the attention of my group, and they were taken aback by it.

Shortly after this, a manager asked to interview me for a job. I knew the job was the wrong fit because the female software lead in the interview was very rude, made strange comments, and kept trying to actively throw me off. I was not going to accept the job. I had a meeting with my boss, where he tells me I'm accepting this job, citing that lay offs are soon coming for our project. I get back to my desk, to an email from my now manager saying he's so happy I accepted the role that was sent during the meeting. Here's the catch - I never accepted the role. My boss did, on my behalf.

Not surprisingly, there are a number of issues with this position.  Things with this new job begin to go sideways quickly - it was clear they didn’t know how to train. Then the next problem was - they wanted a large project completed but refused to give me due dates or break it into deliverable milestones - they also weren't clear about what they wanted. This culiminated into performance issues.

While this is going on, I am being subject to bullying by the female software lead. This includes: 1.) Anytime I embark on a path to complete work, per our group's own procedures this female directs me to do it a different way, 2.) nothing I produce - even if it is exactly what is asked for - is good enough -- she is CONSTANTLY looking for problems, even scrutizing a car accident I was in outside of the office,  3.) hostile messages - which management agrees can be percieved that way but backs her up saying 'she doesn't know how she sounds', 4.) a discussion about said messages and trying to get more in person interaction - led by management culiminates in this female screaming at me saying ""I DO NOT HAVE THE TIME TO TAG UP WITH YOU. I AM BLUNT AND I REFUSE TO CHANGE FOR ANYONE."", 5.) making comments demeaning my skills and abilitites, 6.) mis-perciving something I said during a customer call and then coming up to my desk and making a rude remark, and then sending emails to my boss despite us working together, in person, in the office for the entire week that she doesn't understand my statuses throughout the week at all.

Unexpectedly, I end up at a lunch out with the project manager, wherein she admits to me that herself and others were subject to poor treatment by this individual, admits that the project thought they hired a level 5/6 programmer instead of a level 0 like I said I was in the job interview (she blames my good interview and strong resume but later on I show my resume to a director and the director tells me point blank it is a entry level resume), tells me if I go to HR/Ethics that they will protect the offender because the project can't go on without her, and encourages me to look for Level 1/Level 2 jobs while attempting to smooth things out with this group.

During this time employees told me of numerous stories of poor treatment by the female tech lead causing the issues, and others having to leave the project quickly due to her unrealistic expectations and behavior. More specifically, they confide that her behavior takes a specific pattern of events, namely: 1.) disrespectful comment in interview - in one case it was an attack from this female because the interviewee was a mother - in my case it was for having a 2 year degree, 2) she fails to direct people as to how she wants tasking completed, 3) This then culminates in employees being totally trashed unjustly in end of year reviews. This female has apparently driven numerous people off the project/revolving door.

I report the issues to a director (a mentor in the company told me to do this) who then clued in (this is my understanding) Ethics & HR. The director promised my job would be protected through out the process - which so far it has been.

My boss begins what I feel is retalitory behavior - my responsibilites were completely changed - (I now do 0 coding at all and no timeline is being given as to when I can return to programming), giving me deadlines I could not meet (submitting an entire project daily by a very early morning hour when I am generally on the road at that time doing my 1.5-2 hour commute - which the entire office is aware of). At a later date, my boss says that they did this because I said I was ‘afraid to be alone in the same room as the female software lead.’ I did say that after a meeting where there I was verbally attacked by herself and the chief engineer. I then get a phone call from the HRBP, and I explain my entire experience. She says she wants to possibly escalate this situation to Ethics.

Then we have a meeting with HR (keep in mind, HR is on a phone in another state while my boss and I talk) where my boss is like 'we are here to discuss performance.' For context, I asked him and the PM numerous times if there were performance concerns as this role has just NOT been working out (not phrased like that), and they said no, we'd be having more meetings and discussions if there was a performance concern.

He says in the meeting isn't PIP'ing me. In addition, in this meeting he finally tells me the dates that they expected me to complete work and what specifically they wanted delivered - when they were NEVER able to communicate this despite numerous daily discussions. And remember, I am a Level 1/2  trapped in a Level 5/6 job, the female tech lead is a huge jerk, and this was supposed to be a 2 year degree holder talent development program.

We now start to have weekly tag ups with HR. These are scheduled until 2/11/2025. My issue is, no one is communicating with me. I am ‘not on a pip’ but have to submit a spreadsheet to my boss daily with what I have accomplished. I have no idea what the date 2/11/2025 symbolizes, and no one has bothered to communicate with me.

These meetings are opportunities for my boss to make ‘phony’ claims against me. Many of which I have defended myself against. However, I’m getting concerned about the allegations. For example: suddenly my access was revoked from the software we use for version control (to check in and check out code) and I could not see the contents of any work on there. My boss is claiming that I copy-pasted code. But hasn’t pointed to ‘what code’ I copy pasted. My issues are: a. ) Since I lost my access to version control, I couldn’t check anything in or out, meaning they do not have the most recent versions of my work - so how can they do a fair assessment of my work per the version control  and  how do I know they aren’t unethically modifying my work in some way to make it look like there are performance issues? b.) The female software lead, who is an issue, gave me code on the first day and told me to copy/paste it in, and not modify it. I have proof of this.

Numerous times throughout the process, I ask why HR isn’t moving me to a role of appropriate leveling. They claim that there are ‘opportunities for me’ on this project.  In addition, during one of these ‘weekly meetings’ the HR BP said ‘my boss is giving me an opportunity to turn things around.’ Why am I the one turning things around when they screwed up??

I ended up mentally making the decision to plan to go out on disability/FMLA due to illness I developed due to the stress of this environment. I told no one of my plans until the last minute. Right before I left, the project manager mentioned to me that “the project has been losing money for 6 months, and then we got you, and your skills aren’t as good as you claimed on your resume, so the software team is going to do the work because they can do it faster and leave you out of it.” I never lied on my resume. They hired a Level 0/1 to do a Level 5/6 job, now I'm paying for it with my career.

I would later learn almost every one of my coworkers would call Ethics on the female tech lead/my boss due to how I am being treated in the office, the leveling issue, that I’m clearly becoming physically ill from the stress and that someone escalated the complaint all the way to the top of the company. However, because the ethics investigation didn't start until my last day prior to going on FMLA leave due to stress related health issues, it sounds like the investigation has been canceled or temporarily on hold due to being out on leave. What really pissed me off was, the ethics officer also tried to make it sound like I was 'making assumptions' because I said point blank my boss is writing down everything I do/keeping tabs on it, so I know he's trying to build a case against me. I think it's obvious that I'm being treated like shit.

Weirdly: as part of the change in job responsibilities, I've begun to work closely with the chief engineer who lives in another state. He seems very impresed by me and even mentioend this during a customer call. He makes it sound like if I come in and put in the elbow grease, things can improve... but honestly, I'm doubtful.

Where things are at, are as follows:

\- I am on disability/FMLA until November 18. My doc actually does not want me to return until December 5, but I lose my job protection (if I want to go back) if I stay out that long

\- I am worried if I do return, that I'm going to be walking right into an ethics investigation which is then going to make tensions even worse in the office .... and then likely getting an unjust bad review this year, that I have no recourse against since HR is fully backing my boss.

\- I literally have applied to over 50 positions in the company with 0 success. Largely because I lack the degree and also the instability of funding right now. Another issue is, many have tried to help connect me to jobs, and in some cases, I was even told that I was the hire for the job/official paperwork was being done to move me - just for the job to suddenly fall through at the last moment. I am wondering if I am being blacklisted or sabbotaged from within.

\- I'm turning 30 later in 2025, with only a 2 year degree due to health issues, and am so afraid for my future you have no idea. I no logner want to do programming after this experince -- which was supposed to be a golden oppertunity after a decade of hardship. I would like to go into insurance, but need to finish the degree.

\- My issue is I need to develop a ""skill"" in something. My skills seem to be more related to software, and that isn't going to work considering I want OUT of it. And I think that's my biggest issue - I am largely self taught so my knowledge is all over the place, which is a contributing factor to my situation - I am not an 'expert' in any one area.

\- I am experincing severe stress and health issues from this. But I am terrified of quitting and being poor again and then not being able to get jobs due to my lack of degree.

**What would you do if you were me? I have a couple of options:**

\- I can go back on a part time basis (manager would need to approve - probably would be favorable as they'd pay me less), keep all of my benefits will being part time, and either move when a new internal role opens (finish my degree or other training/education while still working for this company in a new role - want to move into insurance claims or underwriting), or look for jobs outside the company. Everyone I talk to in the company says my experince is really, really, not what they've exprinced at all and I've been unlucky with where I've been placed.

\---- My big worry with this option is that, I will not be successful in finding another job because my time outside of the office will be spent doing self care to recover from the situation in office and exhaustion from my commute. There is also an upcoming hiring freeze, until Spring.

\---- I will admit that I like this option because I feel if I am fully unemployed my anxiety and illness will get worse.

\- I could quit cold turkey - which is more and more attractive with each passing day

\- I could have my doctor write me out until December 5, risk losing this position entirely to a lay off, and start looking for other jobs in the meantime.

\--- Note I've been off for nearly 3 months now and have barely been able to recover between doing interviews for jobs in the company (on the external site) and going to appointments... the stress has been endless. Do I do nothing and just rest?

Another big question:  If I return to work I am considering disclosing my newly discovered disability to my job. Would it be wise to try to blame the performance issues on an undiagnosed/untreated disability? That's one way I think I could save this... I guess.

This is also my first job after a huge career change. When I hired in a year ago, there was no structure or existing documentation. Just my manager who has never had a team before let alone manage.

In July, I had my performance review with him. There were goals I met and others where I didn’t “not meet expectations.” While I agreed with most of the points my manager made, I politely disagreed with him that he did not paint the entire picture and take into consideration my efforts and improvements. He did not rebuttal or provide any commentary regarding my reasonings. Very non-confrontational and changed the subject.

2 months has passed and nothing has been brought up since. I feel like things have gone swimmingly. I understand there’s always room for improvement and I’ve been working on growing into my position. The other day I was unexpectedly sent a meeting invite with my manager and HR… no heads up, no inkling this was coming, nothing. 

During the meeting, the HR rep stayed muted and my manager talked for 7 mins about how the general performance review went and how my overall status is “Does Not Meet Expectations” and we’ll be talking in the next few weeks about improvements. I stayed silent and when I was asked by my manager if I had any questions I said no. Should I not have said no???

Today I had a 1:1 with my manager (we do this every week), and I asked about the performance review and if there was a reason it was resurfaced with HR. All he said was “Their process is slower than ours.” I then asked, “Is there anything I need to be aware of since I’ve not received any communication? Are preparations needing to be made regarding the meeting?” And he, again, was dismissive and non-confrontational and said he needed to cut our meeting short and we would talk more in the next few weeks.

I am very confused about what is happening. I don’t want to be that person, but I’ve not received a negative performance review before. I am working my butt off and having stress dreams over this job as my manager is my only resource for collaboration. And the fact that he won’t actually talk to me about it and I have to keep pressing with questions is highly annoying. I want to know where I stand, how this effects the 1yr pay increase, will it follow me, etc. How do I proceed from here? ",user_619,17,30

Hi everyone,

I have 6 years of experience in the tech industry but took a break last year after having a baby in January. Now, I’m preparing to re-enter the job market, and I’m curious about others' experiences.

For those who’ve taken a career break, especially in tech:

How did the job market treat you when you returned?

Did employers understand your break, or was it challenging to explain?

What strategies helped you stand out or get back on track?

Any tips for balancing job hunting while managing a young child?


I’m excited yet a bit nervous about getting back. Any shared experiences or advice would be really appreciated!

Had a meeting with my manager the other day and he said my code is good, my scripts are well-written and clear in their intended purpose and my SQL is on-point.  He said I do my due diligence, am on top of my tasks, get my work done on time and pass code reviews.  However, he said there is a disconnect and I am not sure what that means.  I am on the spectrum, so I have struggled with seeming ""aloof"" a lot.  I think I will try to seem more engaged in meetings and see it as an area to improve but like... how the hell am I meeting all observable metrics yet there is a ""disconnect?""  Like... socially?  I chose being an engineer because I have terrible social anxiety and don't work well in situations where I need to be Miss Congeniality.  I hate to play the ol misogyny card, but I can't help but wonder if there would be a perceived ""disconnect"" if I were a man.  My former mentor told me about one guy he worked with that would duct tape his feet instead of wearing shoes and everyone put up with it because he was a damn fine engineer and was a master of differential equations.  

Idk its just vague criticism that I will try to find a way to approach constructively.  Women in STEM <3.",user_77,16,16

My former employer allowed me to work part-time... but only 30 hours minimum. I've heard of others being allowed to work 20 hours a week. 

Everyone I've ever heard of working part-time, with the exception of literally one company, started as a full time worker, was senior level, and then negotiated down.

I'd be starting full time and am indeed senior level, but my hope would be that I'd eventually be allowed to drop to part-time status (with full-time availability for messages/meetings/etc and with exclusivity) with an appropriate reduction in pay. I've already tried and failed to find something explicitly part-time, or with an employer open to considering someone working full time while onboarding then dropping to part-time. Plan would be to work full time until they fire/retaliate against me for taking maternity leave and needing to breastfeed (or something like that), but I'd prefer to stay super long term forever at a company and just be allowed to go part-time. Husband has a career path that will later allow him to be part-time, and our joint goal is to both be part-time workers / SAHPs who're passionate about their career.

What are some, if any, 'green flags' that this might be possible? Or if you have this and are willing to share, please please share your experience and/or company!



Former company was remote with flexible hours and went beyond the FMLA minimum (minimum in terms of leave time, which is all I actually really cared about and they were completely inflexible on, but they did pay it fully) and were allegedly very family-friendly/focused/first. They still retaliated and made my life hell for taking leave and breastfeeding. The MEN who'd taken leave and weren't performing nearly as well were meanwhile celebrated for those things. Makes me feel extra jaded about the whole thing, and that I can't really trust anything, though I guess I'd look for a company that had a longer leave if I could afford to be picky.",user_625,16,4

1. \*\*Personalized Product Recommendations by Skin Type\*\*: Users can select their skin type—oily, dry, or combination—and get customized product suggestions that work best for their specific needs. For example, if someone has an oily T-zone but dry cheeks, the app will recommend products suited to each area, helping makeup stay put and look flawless throughout the day.

2. \*\*Skin Tone Matching with a Selfie\*\*: By taking a selfie in natural light, users will get a list of product matches for their exact skin tone. This includes recommendations for foundation, concealer, blush, contour, and more. Users can add their favorite products to a personal list and, with a single click, view price comparisons and store options for where to purchase.

3. \*\*Water-Based vs. Oil-Based Preferences\*\*: The app lets users specify if they prefer water-based or oil-based products. Based on this choice, the app will filter product options accordingly to match preferences.

These are just a few of the features I’m planning for the app (don't want to give too much away)—I have so many more ideas in the works! I’d love to hear your thoughts on these features and any suggestions for what else might make the app even better. I know similar apps exist, but this is a personal project I’m working on for fun.

I feel I don't have the logic to solve certain issues when they arise, to give an example, I was trying to deploy pyroscope and beyla. I was following the documentation, which has errores so it was not working for me, basically the endpoint on the documentation were not the correct ones, so I asked a per for help and with a describe pod we were able to see the right endpoint. Or we did a k get svc, I don't quite remember, but I feel I am not able to think like him.

Getting anything done is a game of telephone that goes on for weeks.

All that could be manageable but she also has poor people skills.

The other woman on the team was hired at the same time as me but doesn't have boundaries and gets bullied.

I don’t have a strong network, only 5 years of experience at one very niche company. 

No certifications but an advanced degree though unrelated to my field. 

I was not trying to leave this company and don’t have a LinkedIn for privacy reasons, but I am assuming I need that now.

Has anyone used a recruiter and also other than LinkedIn where should I look for jobs? Final thought, has anyone switched form tech to consulting like Boston Consulting Group or Deloitte etc? 

Happy to listen to advice and thoughts. If you e worked with any recruiters you trust enough to refer much appreciated. Also I strictly prefer work from home but I guess with the situation I’m in I may have to reconsider that…

I am completely burned out as a product manager and believe I’m better at execution than strategy (or at least I’m tired of trying to convince a room full of men to listen to my ideas). I realize sexism exists in almost every role in tech, but there’s something incredibly demoralizing about being criticized/penalized for not having the same style of “leadership” and “initiative” as my male counterparts and then being denied opportunities and career advancement because of gender bias. I feel like I’m constantly fighting to prove myself and I want to pivot into something that plays to my strengths. Also, I can’t keep bringing this negativity home with me - I’m pregnant and my job is stressing me out. I have to make a change to retain some semblance of mental health. Phew, rant over. 

All that being said, has anyone successfully made the pivot away from product management into program management? Can you make a lateral move or do you start from the bottom? Do HMs look for purely program experience (for product management, they prefer candidates with the same title even if a candidate has transferable skills)?

So I started a new job about 2 months ago(cybersecurity), I liked it at first I am getting introduced to new tools and I have certain applications that I own. I am starting to feel like the applications that I own are the least technical and the most mundane.  

Recently I was asked to write a playbook with someone who is my counter part, we had a meeting and he showed me the playbook he created and I showed him mine.  So I suggested that we combine ours as mine went into more detail, I emailed this to him and our boss nothing no response.  

We had a meeting last week and the contributions that I had were not present. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING I wrote was there, the other (2) people on the team were like yeah this is great.  I have a background in IR and DFIR so I am very detailed oriented when it comes to things like this.  His was just basic things there is nothing wrong with it but if you experience a breach or are in the middle of an attack being very specific and detailed will help at that moment and later on. 

At the same time last week  my boss asked me to find out if certain applications use “X” I did that sent him a spreadsheet never heard back from him. So today he asked me a question so I in turn responded but asked if the document he requested was what he was looking for. NO RESPONSE, just acted as if I didn’t even say anything.  

I took about a year off because of burnout and mental health. I guess my question is am I looking into this *too much* or am I spot on. 

Why even ask me to write a playbook/IR plan and not only do you not use it you act as if it doesn’t even matter.  I have a gap in my resume for about a year, I want to leave but I have a year gap and I know me trying to jump ship after (2) months is a bad look.  

I am working on getting some new  certifications and renewing others.  Any thoughts or suggestions is greatly appreciated.  ",user_643,15,6

I also have an offer at a very early stage startup with a lot of funding. That offer is better but would require me to relocate and work in office.  It's risky but it's a blank check as far as tech goes. A lot of potential but very disruptive to my personal life.

A bootstrap startup, and both myself and my co-founder are women. We're creating a website and e-commerce store for women, and feel strongly in creating a supportive community. Both myself and my COO have marketing backgrounds, but don't have the time to execute. I'm operating as CEO & CTO and my COO has a lot on her plate.

* Someone who's comfortable talking about sex- we talk about kinks, spicy fiction tropes, and all kinds of smutty stuff in our day to day work
* Someone with a marketing background who is skillful at content creation, campaign creation, and is familiar with SM algorithms (specifically Tumblr, IG, TikTok)
* Someone who's familiar with or interested in the spicy book industry/NSFW fanfiction community
* Someone who has time. I will be working full time on the company in the new year. I need a CMO who can dedicate at least 20 hrs a week.

Background: I went to a technical HS in the US where I had CS electives, mainly HTML and Python coding. Graduated in 2007. Went to university, started out in CS. Fell “out of love” but really it was probably burn out from personal family issues. Went to Chemical engineering for a semester and then last minute went into Philosophy as a really horrible, rash last minute attempt to try to make it into law school. Then some time after finishing, the job market was insane and my options for grad school hit the fan as there was a market saturation for lawyers… many were lucky to even get paralegal gigs, so I decided to go to grad school for transportation engineering. I’m in a state where there were many programs for CS and transportation engineering to fill the “intelligent transportation sector” demand for software engineers and data scientists. I did this until COVID (2020), then switched to a remote SWE position where I’ve done so many things — Full Stack (Flask), Cloud (AWS), even advanced BI/Analytics. 

Had my first kid in December 2021. Was leading a successful product as a lead developer. Company got acquired in early 2024. Now I am watching this product line fail because of the result of mass lay offs from the merge, a change in focus, and chaos ensued after lack of a strategic downsizing plan. The new Product Officer has decided to lead a hunt to cut some of the “unnecessary” products, and the product line I work on may be one. I have two kids now, and just can’t deal.

If they let me go, I figure it would buy me time to invest in a new focus. Whether that’s staying in CS or moving to a new career entirely, but the staying in CS is more practical as I have expenses related to childcare etc to worry about. Just curious if anyone has advice on what is stable (even if not necessarily flashy or high paying). But part of me wants to so badly just… take a break. Maybe I need something else to do? I have even considering just starting my own cleaning company just to get out and be productive, and here there is a shortage so the pay isn’t bad at all if you want to be an independent house cleaner or organizer.

I have about 4 years of experience as a Quality Assurance engineer. The job market is terrible here in Europe too. I've been applying constantly, so far I only got one offer.
That offer is very low payed🥹 I did state my expectations, but they went lower. To add to it, it would require me to move to another city where renting an apartment is super expensive. I would not be able to live comfortably at all.

Let's say I do have some savings, meaning I will not starve to death if I don't take this. And there are multiple reasons why I should not, I am very tired, have PTSD, this workplace trauma has just added more to it. I would really need some rest.
I feel afraid, and panic at the thought that I might end up working with deceitful and manipulative people again.

I am a person who always pushed forward, took chances and tried hard. This is the first time I am reconsidering, to just lay low and not go and fight. 

I am afraid, since I do not know when will I get another job offer. This is the first one I got in 4-5 months. What if I have to wait even more? What if I don't get a second chance?

But still, I am trying to be loving towards myself. This job does not deserve this much investment from me. I want to be kind and pay attention to what I need at the moment.

Hi. I have been identifying more, and more with a lot of the stories here, and would love to hear what did you do in similar situations, or if anything good came out of it, and I want to simply vent.

I work a tech startup but I am not a technical role. I don’t want to give too many details, but my role is critical as it supports the entire company in many areas of the business, including employees. I am also a 1 person department. You could say I am part of the senior management team. I joined this company since its early years, I was hired in the first 10 employees, and we’ve grown around 10x.

I like the company’s product, and co-founders, and all my colleagues. I truly enjoy working there since a good chunk of years now. 

I work 60-80 hours a week, including weekends most of the year. I deeply care about my profession, and my work. I have 7 years of experience, and I am good at my job.

My manager is in C-Suite and to me it’s becoming more apparent that they are manipulating me, and others.
I have raised critical, important issues that weren’t even considered, and were shut down because it wasn’t convenient for them, or because they just don’t have a clue of what it meant, and the importance of my profession. These issues are now having a massive impact on the entire company’s strategic plans for next year. This is impacting critical roles. 
They also seem to manipulate because they say completely conflicting things, for example, not granting 1 hire to help support a big team base at three digits big, because “hires only bring more work in training them and onboarding them” lol, but loves contractors, letting them go, and cutting expenses because their plan is not working, training those as they come and go, every time. I have many more examples like these, not only to me, but to their other direct reports too. They have acknowledged that to me.

In our chat tool, we have a group with the co-founders, and other high level leaders where we discuss confidential and strategic projects that their results are determined with data, and the company’s resources, and practices. These projects are often in ranges and multiple options are used, but with 1 single target as a tool to succeed in said project.
A manager needed this information, and I went ahead and offer a couple options, each at different beneficial levels in the spectrum of the data for the project. They asked if option b was the final tool to which I responded I thought it was on the higher end of the spectrum but it would need to ultimately be determined on more qualifying factors to grant option b, and asked to one of the co-founders as they are directly involved, what was their opinion.
My manager proceeds to bomb message me asking me in the group if I was saying my own recommendation was wrong, to which I responded no, just saying the fact which indeed was in the furthest end, and asks me again. It felt like an attack. It makes me think I suck, and what I am saying is completely wrong.

This is the mental state they put me in, preventing me from actually continue to outperform according to the plan. They don’t let me do my job. They don’t understand it, or there’s genuine, pure dislike for me, and I don’t understand why. I cry at least 2 days a week. All my therapy sessions are about my job. The conversations with my partner, friends and family are about how frustrating, and disappointing is.

Why do I need to leave a job that I like doing, I like my responsibilities if only they would let me do them. I like my colleagues.

I have had somewhat honest conversations with them, but my manager is scary, and imposes, and intimidates. Their direct reports (they have worked with this manager in the past and have confirmed with me they have also felt gaslighted and manipulated at times), however my manager has special treatment with them. 

Do I need to play politics? I have reached out to other leaders whose job is rooted to high ethics foe their opinion on the projects, but even them have ignored me. Mind you, they got granted a juicy ask by this manager.

I have reached my end, and have been crying for hours. Why can’t I be successful? Allowed to grow? I want to take back control of my professional life, but I can’t because what if I actually suck at my job? It scares me to find a new job right now. It’s hard. I depend on my salary to live, I feel I can’t just leave.

I used to respect, and seek their mentorship, and opened to them about certain weaknesses, which I now realize is using against me.

Is this all about my anxiety? Am completely wrong?

Even though my last 8 years prior to being laid off was leading technical teams in a Manager and Program Manager capacity and the roles I'm currently being offered I have done for 10+ years prior to going into management. They see my experience and practically salivate that I'm so perfect, check all the boxes and then some. I explain my experience far exceeds their requirements and it seems to shock them. The hourly rate, if it's even brought up, is always low. Conversely when I get on the phone with a recruiter for a higher role (lateral), the tone in their voice is always suspicious like I need to prove I can do this even after my resume says I have many years operating extremely successfully in a managerial capacity. I'm obviously very happy to explain who I am and what I can do and I know my resume accurately represents my skills and experience. A recent recruiter only changed his tone after doing an early reference check with 2 of my previous colleagues, after which, his attitude changed entirely to the positive. I'm at a loss, how much longer must I have to ""prove"" I have adequate qualifications (multiple degrees and certifications) for positions that are a lateral to my previous roles which I held for many years? God forbid I apply for something higher?

I'm a Data Engineer working on a predominantly male team for the last 6mo. This is abnormal for me as both my previous tech roles I've worked on women lead teams where I was the sole male developer.

Currently, the only women on the team are the project manager WW, a lead analyst WW, and my director WW. The analyst and I have a great working relationship. The other members are male, stereotypical data analyst and engineering talent, generally agreeable folks.

**TEAM Challenges**

There are some existing, and I think objective antipatterns in management that our scrum team faces:

1. We aren't self organizing (ticketed work has often been directly assigned to us by the director)
2. We don't allocate any dedicated time to refactoring

These issues have been brought up before on anonymous retro boards when we had a different woman PM \*(Black Woman)  was more open to scrum and we had some pretty negative reactions from the director to the questions and feedback that were given on retro boards.

This PM (BW) who I was pretty close to was laid off and the the current program manager took her place. Both her and the director are very close. Sprint retros were subsequently cancelled. IMO the feedback environment is pretty non-existent and in informally polling my peers people generally believe giving feedback on team org or management is pretty risky.

**Complicated Environment and Introduction of Sexism?**

The team is mostly working with a legacy stack but the enterprise is currently undergoing a pretty rapid period of change due to the hiring of many senior platform engineers hired with the mandate to modernize our stack.

In this modernization effort many of the original team leadership have been laid off as well on the software dev and data side. My director is the only one from the old guard who is still left.

The replacements are 100% male (White and Indian), and are bringing a lot of good things such as the assumption that teams will be self organizing, strong modern data stack experience, as well as some maybe questionable or sexist cultural norms.

For example, the small group of women on the team have been appointed or self appointed the ""Party Planners"" when the tech team gets together from out of town.

Our PM in addition to setting up meeting times and locations has been running presentation slides for the Indian men in their presentations with our team.

**Central Question**

I like my director personally, she's really nice, but she doesn't have a history of being open and flexible and probably needs to adapt to survive and position the team to generate more value.

I am under utilized on my current team and pretty frustrated with the lean or top down management style. I want to improve the way my team functions. Exposing the disfunction externally, or switching teams will weaken my director's position politically and potentially result in her being laid off. No reports = no reason to exist in management. I also think the new guard might see her through a sexist lens and could dispose of her with any real reason.

Do you have any advice on how to provide feedback or help the team in this sort of environment? If you had a direct report like me how would you prefer that I handle this conversation in an upcoming 1v1? Should I say anything at all or just sit on my hands?

  
**Edit:**

**Thanks so much for all the responses and feedback. It's so helpful to have others point out where I might be biased and sharpen how I'm thinking of this situation.** ",user_655,14,13

Fast forward to today, a person (different from the previous recruiter) called me to tell me I got the job. I was in a busy cafe and had a hard time hearing him, otherwise I would have asked more questions, but he seemed pretty adamant that I sign the offer letter by EOD. Lastly, a different, third person sends the offer letter, also saying to accept by EOD. Now, I'm on the west coast, so do they mean east coast EOD? I talked the situation over with a friend and my fiance, and they said to take the role because we determined there is enough evidence online of the agency being a legitimate business.

SHORT VERSION

I have an assertive female boss who asked what would help me catch details more, that I've been letting slip in a new job. She's awesome, also very Type A, a little reactive, and straight-up asks what she can do to help me retain info, like trying to pull my needs out of me. I’m a trauma survivor and have a hard time asking for my needs, her pushing me to open up almost makes me roll up even more in my shell. I'd like a quieter tone and time to process, without feeling rude to her. “I hear quietness better than loudness.”

Can I say this to her? ""I work best when important matters and constructive feedback are delivered in a calm tone. This helps me process them with a level head and implement them, and not become distressed."" (Advice from ChatGPT lol.)

She wants me to lead and be more assertive reporting updates to executives, flagging issues, etc, and a calm mindful tone would really help me do that instead of wallflower-ing. (I'm almost 2 months in and slowly getting more comfortable with the colleagues)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

EXTENDED CONTEXT

This has happened to me twice with awesome women bosses. Their style is to apply pressure to address issues, but also charm & praise to encourage good performance. I think they’re learning how to manage me, because I can be hard to read at first. (In Myers-Briggs they're ENFP and I'm INFP.) I do want to thank them for how they go above & beyond for their reports, just after I get my calm lol, and us women in Tech should support each other. (The first boss, I blew up at and she distanced from me, hence asking here to do things differently this time.)

They’re good at reacting in the moment, my style is to take time to process info, then come up with a more mindful holistic approach. (And often long-term more effective, addressing the root cause instead of a band-aid fix, putting docs in for the org, etc.) (I do speak up and lead quite readily when people aren't bickering with each other or raising their voices, which I noticed executives tend to do more, but from a caring place.",user_108,13,31

I started working at my current job at the end of June, a position I’ve had lined up since January. It pays well, has great benefits, and lots of learning opportunities. However I’m struggling a lot mentally because it’s a software development role - I have a decent amount of experience and was truthful about it in my interviews, but every day I come into work it feels like I have no idea how to do anything, and I’m not getting much guidance. It feels like I show up to wait out a 9 hour workday. 

My coworkers are all men, all married, with masters or PhD’s in physics, engineering, or CS. They’ve all worked here for years. It’s very difficult for me to relate to them and it’s also difficult to not feel like I have to prove myself to them, which is difficult because like I said I feel like I have no idea what I’m doing. 

I know it takes a while to learn your job, and I’m also dealing with isolation from being new to the area as a whole. Is this normal for first starting to work? Am I being pessimistic and overthinking everything? Will things really get better?

The gist of is that I feel inadequate when speaking with dev. I sometimes preface my questions with ""this might be a stupid question but..."" After a meeting or discussion, I sometimes feel so stupid because I asked what I think is a basic question that I should know. 

I never got negative feedback, my manager trusts my judgement and overall I know management is happy with me, but still, I can't get over this. Most of it is probably in my head, but still, here I am.

I joined the firm a year ago, and was the only engineer working on two vertical products for six months. I had almost zero support from manager, and at the end of six month, I got a pay raise and got informed that would start to report to another manager instead, who supposed to better manage the team with proper work assignment etc.  Ever since then, I only had five 1:1 in total (not on regular basis, all upon my requests), and my skip manager formally informed everyone to direct work to my manager instead of coming directly to me. Yet no work has ever been assigned properly from my manager, I gradually lost all resource and work. On our fifth 1:1, my manager threw a pip doc in my face, listing out all the “incidents” caused by my wrong doing, all of which, he was involved from first place yet looked like I’m the only one to blame for. Even during my first week in pip, my manager didn’t reply a single message from me, and after reporting to our HR, he started writing on all our conversation and giving me hard time during code reviews etc.

Our team is mostly Caucasian men, and upon talking to other engineers on the team, three people in total got put on pip around same time as me. And after more investigations, all the minority (non white) engineers seem all at some point got a pip document from the management- some of them resigned already, and some due to visa and other reason chose to grind and stay.  

Our company CEO and CTO are married, CTO’s brother is the main IC on Eng team, and CEO’s mum is working on accounting team. The current head of HR is actually CFO, which is also close to the “family groupie”. Our last official head of HR decided to quit four months after joining the firm.

I’m currently on H1B visa, but I just got married weeks ago and my partner is US citizen. I guess visa won’t be a big concern for me if I just resign, yet I think I should do sth since there are other minority / ppl on visa on the team, and everyone gets somehow “abused” by the management.  There are six more days left on my pip,  shall I resign before pip ends and complain to HR, or stay till last day of my pip if I get fired then i file complain to EEOC? I was thinking file gender discrimination, yet looks like may also fall into category of gender / racial discrimination in general. Happy to hear ppl’s thoughts on this. ",user_665,13,19

Too much of a generalist? Not senior enough? ,"Background: 7 years as a business analyst, 2 as a product owner, and currently a product communication specialist (not by choice). I don’t have a software development background but did data analysis in the past.

I joined my current company in 2022 as a product owner (the only woman on the team) but felt misaligned from the start. I stayed thinking it was self-doubt speaking. Despite positive performance reviews, I never found support for product development or alignment with my manager.

After a merger, my responsibilities were handed to the lead developer, and I was sidelined to documentation and demos. This led to intense anxiety, therapy, and medication. 

Earlier this year, I was moved into a product evangelist role, which felt like a fresh start. But six months in, my ideas are ignored, presentations are interrupted by my manager (who sometimes even repeats exactly what I said during presentations), and there’s no real support or feedback. I feel stuck.

I’m job hunting, updating my CV, getting feedback on it, but feel too much like a generalist to fit specific roles. Business analyst positions are rare in my area, and I doubt product ownership suits me.

Question: How do I find roles as a jack-of-all-trades? I’m working on confidence and assertiveness but need direction on finding a good career fit. I'm open to gaining new skills - yrs ago I paid some coding courses hoping to get more technical but unsure if that's useful. 

Anyone been through this and found a way forward?

I am no exception. You ignore it. However, this time around it was different. I was getting stared down the ENTIRE time by multiple males from other companies. I don’t say this with any exaggeration. Literally, I could feel their gaze on my every move. I could see them staring from the corner of my eye every time I noticed them. One person even came up to me and asked me my ethnicity. Whatever, I am used to ethnicity questions being asked but I am certainly not used to getting this level of attention.  Let me also mention that one of them was married. I informed my manager about this and I told him I usually call people out and he was 10000% supportive. Now that I think of it maybe it’s not a good idea to do that. I was thinking of doing the following moving forward: 
1) Maybe I can be more confident and every time they look my way shrug my shoulders and sign “what?”
2) if the person is staring and I am with someone, I can point at the person staring and ask them to look at them

I am a mentor for my college Women in Science and Engineering program, and in about 5 hours I will be telling my “STEM story” to an audience of girl sophomore high school students. I did not have time to revise it fully, and I just want to get some second opinions:) It is currently 5am so I will probably sleep for a bit. Just want to get a second pair of eyes, and see that I dont sound fully dumb😭 here it is:

*blah blah introduction blah my major is electrical engineering* Today I am here to talk about my journey in STEM. I clearly remember being in your same position, not knowing what the future held for me. Unsure about what I wanted, and scared for what was to come. And I remember it so clearly because even now I still feel that way sometimes. To talk about my journey in STEM I feel the need to mention the confusion I faced as a high school student, and the immense fascination that eventually led me to choose engineering. As a high school student I was always fascinated by mathematics, and how everything was truly connected. It started from something as simple as the pythagorean theorem, and all I could think is “woah, how can this two numbers somehow be connected?”. That same fascination is what I now feel with learning much more complex topics such as Fourier Transform, used for medical imagining. Math is truly everywhere, and I think its beautiful. With all that being said, I dont want it to be misunderstood that it has been easy. The same girl that was so fascinated by her Geometry, Calculus, and Trigonometry classes was the same one to major in Criminology at the start of her college career. It is scary to start a journey in a field where we were told for so long we didn’t belong. It is ironic that many women before me had to fight for their right to an education, while i had to convince myself I am worthy of it. Now, because of the determination, bravery, and resilience of many women before me we have the chance to step into classrooms, labs, and jobs that once were unimaginable. As women we will be doubted over and over again, but it is our resilience that shows everyone that we have earned those spots. Sometimes I still question myself when I walk into a classroom full of men if I have been just lucky to make it this far, but this same feeling is what drives me to become the best engineer I can be. To be the best woman I can be, to see a world where every girl knows she belongs in STEM. Our voices, our perspectives, and our ideas are essential to keep moving forward in STEM. And every challenge every single one of us overcomes proves that even though the system was not built for us, we are strong enough to make our place within it. ",user_672,12,5

Context: I’m the only woman in a team of 5 Java developers. I was in an another team last year, went on maternity leave and, upon my return, was told about the transfer to this team. I didn’t have much choice, and wasn’t terribly happy about the move. However, the situation is such that I couldn’t refuse. Due to circumstances I need to stick it out here for some more time.

Issue: I feel like the team doesn’t want me here. I feel like I’ve being setup for failure. 

Examples:
1) Before starting development for my first ticket, I asked a team mate what is the review, testing and deployment process followed in the team. He provided some info. I followed the process he shared. With the way their git pipeline is setup, I ended up deploying my changes to an E2E region used by multiple teams which led to some errors. 
Note - There is no documentation at all about this process, and each team does their own thing. I’ve been documenting the process as I find out something. Even now, after 3+ months, I’m being told something new about this process.

2) Reviews for my PRs are pending for 1 week+. As a contrast, 2 teammates’ PRs were raised, reviewed and merged before anyone looked at mine. I make sure I am proactive with reviews (within 24 hrs of a request).

I have more examples if someone wants them. 

Personally I know I sometimes speak a bit abrasively or directly (English is not my first language and my partner tells me I am too assertive and not polite) and I take things literally (instead of reading cues) when someone asks questions. Is this mommy brain? Am I allowing my irritation at being moved to another project cloud my judgement or interactions? Does anyone have tips on how to navigate such a situation?

Please help. Every time I feel like things are improving, and then it turns out there was a team meeting about our tech debt and I wasn’t invited. Or there was a biweekly meeting with product support team and again I wasn’t informed nor invited. And this is more than 3 months after I joined the team. Surely, by now I don’t need to ask people to add me to meetings?",user_676,13,10

I've been remote for over a decade, long before the pandemic. I took this role because even though the company has a hybrid work model, my manager doesn't give a shit where I work bc my entire team is based on the east coast. I 'technically' work in an office about an hour and a half from my house but since I don't work directly with any of the people in that location, I have been operating at home without issue. 

As acquisitions go, they are examining all of the buildings to decide which ones stay after TOB. They've started monitoring badge swipes (biiig fucking ick, btw) and my manager reached out to say that my name was flagged and I needed to 'get off the list'. This is fine by me, but I don't know if I can do it long term. They offered me a 6 figure retention bonus, paid in 2 installments. One at TOB and another if I stayed for a year post TOB. It is generally easy for me to land a new role but I am stuck on what I should do. Do I avoid the pain of the acquisition, commuting into a depressing office 2x a week, and lose the bonus?

I know I should be more excited about it, especially in this market, but it's been a rough 4 years and I'm really worried that I won't have the energy in a new role while also not feeling it's sustainable to stay at the current one. 

I was already burnt out from a previous job from 2020, having to navigate joining during the pandemic and then being impacted by a mass layoff in 2022. Spent months looking and finally found a role at my current company, where I was bullied daily by a truly crazy woman and basically was forced to leave (post about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/12ao5zc/former_manager_made_my_life_hell_and_i_finally/)). In between, there were deaths in the family that I'm still processing, I worked several random jobs just to pay bills, had a miscarriage and later received an endometriosis diagnosis, and separately had 2 skin cancer scares (runs in the family). I was then brought back to my current company under the wing of someone I enjoyed working with in the 2020 job who also moved over. It was smooth sailing for about 6 months until he suddenly quit and ""retired"" early. My one advocate in the company was gone and it was back to navigating intense politics by myself. Almost every day, I was submitting 5-10 job applications and it's been a very difficult year, narrowly escaping several rounds of layoffs. 

Despite this, in the current role, I've managed to carve out a space for myself and a dedicated team, and found a good manager. Outside of my team though, people are generally hostile and very siloed, and the work is mind-numbingly boring and slow. Since I have a small team, my day-to-day is a lot more administrative and it's honestly been cushy. Pay is excellent but there is almost no growth and job security is low as the company has announced layoffs again.  

In the new role, I will be by myself again with the possibility for a team next year. People seem genuinely nice and have young energy, and the work is a lot more interesting and fast-paced. I would definitely be learning more and my day-to-day would be a lot more task-oriented. Pay is about 10% less but there are growth opportunities in the company and outside, as it is a somewhat different industry.  

Part of me knows I should be taking the risk and going to the new role, but the other part doesn't want to leave my current team and wants to embrace the comfort of the current role. The new role needs me to start right away, so I can only take 1-2 weeks off in between. I asked about a month and they were very resistant to that, saying that they can't onboard new employees during Thanksgiving week or in December. I would love to take off more time but I only have about 6 months of savings and based on my luck in this job market, it could take much longer than 6 months to find a new role.

I've been a .NET developer for 11 years. Still, I haven't been able to get past mid level. I made the leap and went for a senior role last time around. I took initiative and when asked to lead the security fixes, did it, and presented my findings monthly. Always before the next report came out. I also worked on features and bugs. The SDLC is fine, I had no issues with the code review process, or any of that. About three months in, I was starting to feel like I had a good handle of our codebase: about nine microservices, and five front end projects. My manager told me in a 1:1 that I needed to go through all the skills tests that I did upfront plus three more for SQL, C#, and Angular. I got slightly above average on all three. I went to take the last test, which was 8 programming questions on TestDome. By the time I finished reading the first question, the time was up. My screen was recorded and Webcam recording on as well. I sent my manager a message and said ""I can't take a test where I'm expected to fail"". Immediately was called into a meeting and fired. 

The place before that used React and I was brand new to it, coming from working on cross platform mobile apps with MAUI. After six months, despite increasing velocity, they called me into a meeting one morning and said I wasn't fast enough and fired me. 

The one before that was mobile apps. I worked on them for a year and a half. Before I got laid off from that one, because there were no other contracts to put me on, I got kicked off the team for ""taking too long"" to go through a code review one of the neckbeard personality devs gave me with 1,100 comments. Mostly on things a linter would fix easily or things that didn't look right in a language we barely used(the app was in 67 languages). 

I'm tired. I constantly feel like I'm not good enough. It's been two months since I was laid off and I've exhausted my savings. I'm doing Uber and just got a job as a school bus driver. I'm happy for that. My boyfriend said I was making the wrong move in thinking about selling my house. An apartment would be roughly the same payment each month, but I could use the profit to pay down debt and be able to live on less.

I took the bus driver gig because there's downtime where I'm getting paid (like the hour it takes kids to play a volleyball game or a few hours for a field trip) where I'm getting paid but can sit on the bus and study. 

I don't know how to approach trying to get another job. I feel like a complete failure. I've always been more of a creative sort, but I love problem solving and coding. I want to get back to it, but feel blacklisted in my small community from these terminations. I have a pluralsight subscription and plan on going through the c# and javascript paths beginning to end, and going through the leetcode 75, although it doesn't always make sense to me how they solve problems since I have nifty things like LINQ that deal with collections for me. I'm not the fastest, but I work hard to get things done, and I'm willing to do the work nobody else wants to do. That's how I got into mobile development in the first place. 

Couple questions:
1. How did you find a mentor? 
2. What should I do to increase my interview chances with a lot of short term gigs? 
3. I'm more of a silly, extroverted person, but tone things down in the office. How can I be myself without not being taken seriously? 
4. How do I deal with the personality conflicts with egotistical male colleagues?  ",user_682,12,27

Since then I've been mostly working part time to assist in finding hires for open positions(recruitment). I'm now considering getting back into the field.

I don't have a college/university degree. I started out as a solder(solderer? Not sure how to call it in English) for several years, got some training with VHDL and did some FPGA programming for a few years before moving to my latest job.

That company was mostly a subcontractor and had a huge variety of projects, so I ended up doing a million different things in my 9 years there. It started with VHDL again but eventually I moved into bootstrapping, BSP programming, cryptography, Android native development, some web programming, some database work and a lot of politics and client negotiations. I ended up as a technical project lead before leaving.

What I'm trying to say is that I have a lot of very wide but very shallow experience. It was very much an ""everyone does everything"" kind of workplace, where I had to learn about a topic, work on it for 6 months to a year then move on to the next.

So now I'm not sure what to do. I suppose my best bet is to look for work as an ""Embedded Real-Time Software Developer"" or some such, which is the majority of what I did. But I don't have a college degree and it seems like most places would immediately exclude me for that. Does anyone have any tips? I don't think going back now to get a CS degree is an option.

However, this week, my manager fully sided with my co-worker during our discussion and even said that I’m on HR’s radar, threatening to put me on an improvement plan (which later after talking to different team's manager I found out that this is a complete lie that my manager made up). Additionally, I had requested vacation time for October, but my manager dismissed it, saying the timing wasn’t right and that we should revisit it in two months. This was frustrating because, so far, I’ve only taken three sick days this year and no vacation. I had even planned to take time off in August but had to cancel due to unfinished work refinements.  
  
Conversations with my manager used to be positive, but things changed abruptly, and now I’m constantly stressed about getting fired or not finding another job in this tough market. I barely got any sleep this entire week since that conversation with my manager.   
  
I'm thinking of taking long leave. But after I come back from long leave most likely the managers will terminate the employment. I'm applying for other jobs but the market conditions are pretty tough.

I’ve also set up an appointment with my primary care physician to discuss the anxiety and depression I’ve been experiencing and to get documentation to support a short-term disability (STD) leave. I’m planning to talk to HR about taking STD, but I’m hesitant to share the details about my issues with my manager because I’m afraid HR might inform them.

I’m not sure about the right sequence of steps to take. Should I meet with the doctor first, then talk to HR, get the paperwork in order, and notify my manager? Or will HR handle that communication? What if my manager doesn’t agree and tries to terminate me sooner?",user_686,12,4

Career stability vs financial stability","Late 20s, F. 

~1M NW at the moment due to lucky startup successes 

I graduated in a rough job market during COVID crisis with a degree in computer science (top school). These past 4 years tech job market has been very unstable and cutthroat, and while I’ve always envisioned to do SWE / AI / a technical role, to get financial stability I picked up whatever non-technical job came my way at startups for several years at various companies and grinding really hard to pick up the skills on the job. 

My resume has enough breadth that I can get any entry / mid-level role in tech (marketing, design, data science, ai, full stack, pm, consulting, data science… etc). 
I am a true “can wear many hats” person. 

These are all side quests from what I’ve always dreamed of doing. 

This past year, I finally was able to get a technical role in generative AI working on LLMs, but due to toxic changes in management, I was managed out a during a 2 week medical leave and told I was not “technical enough” for the role (despite only positive feedback from my peers and a positive performance review). I am now forced to go back to a non-technical role within the company.  During this time our company stock did amazingly well and I have a TC of ~700k. I will probably never have this TC again.  

However, I’m frankly getting burnt out in non-technical roles and overall the instability of my career, and my current company. I really don’t see myself doing this for long term, especially if I’m trying to have a family in 2-5 years. Constant meetings, politics, stakeholder management, inflexible hours, misalignment, and lack of respect or credit given. Only being put in junior roles with no promotions and forced to do random roles I see no future in. Very toxic culture (think Amazon) with high layoff rate. All of which I find extremely unfulfilling and stressful and affecting my mental and physical health.
I am craving stability, and building my technical skills again in the hopes I can have a more stable career. 

Right now, based on recent accomplishments, I have many opportunities to pursue some roles at other companies that I’ve always wanted to do (ML research engineer at FAANG / FAANG adjacent companies or startups) for about 200k-300k, where I can learn high value technical skills and solve interesting problems. My LinkedIn is being flooded with opportunities. 

In 2-3 years from now, I’m hoping to find a job that is stable, good wlb, flexible hours, remote work, financial security, and not soul crushing corporate politics, and I feel fulfilled from the problems I’m solving. In general I would like to prioritize begin mental and physical health, family, and work life balance. 

My choices are: 
1. Stay and get that extra money ($1M on the table after 1.5 years of vesting) continuing in role I see no future in, and prioritize financial stability > career stability. After this I will have enough financial stability that I can take a lower paying job for better WLB. 

2. Switch to ML engineering and grow in that realm, prioritizing career stability > financial stability. 

I see the job market changing a lot with AI, with a lot of non technical jobs getting automated away. I also believe keeping my technical skills fresh is super important, especially if I can ride the AI wave. 

In general, the whole tech market seems to continue to be unstable and cut throat, and my partner said “the best stability you can have is to continue to adapt to the market.”

I also thrive in startups, and am not doing well at big company corporate politics, and again I am worried about my future stability.

1) should I save the homework and projects I am doing with the classes I’m taking rn? 

2) how am I able to build a website for free? I see a lot of portfolios have their own domain… how can I do this? 

3) is a “portfolio” basically a domain where you attach all your work in there? If so, how can I make it where all my work is cohesive in there to show candidates once I do finish some classes?

Reaching out to this community to ask for mentorship and support from women in tech who resonate with my story. I’m open to any wisdom, anecdotes, or reflections anyone has for me.

I’m 25, living my dream lifestyle in SF, and working at a medium/large-sized tech company. I've been here for 2.5 years, I have relative job security (my company has done minimal layoffs and I’m on a pretty secure team.)

In the last year, I’ve gone on a bit of a metaphysical / spiritual journey and I’m starting to understand the deeper meaning of why I’m here and what my purpose as a human is. This was largely catalyzed by somatizing the guilt of witnessing a US imperialist-backed genocide in Palestine and connecting my struggle to the structures of patriarchy, white supremacy, and capitalism. Part of this awakening has led to me realize that my company’s goals are completely fake and inconsequential to the greater good of society (even though they have great propaganda that convinces all of us that we’re helping people “solve problems” / typical tech company shit). I am also working through the guilt of being in this position of privilege, but I also understand that it wouldn’t help anyone if I quit this job with no backup plan.

This type of thinking is inherently antithetical to what we are asked to do in this industry, which is put things in boxes, think in binaries, and report up the chain in pseudo-serfdom hierarchy. I know I sound negative, but once I started learning about how capitalism works and how colonial thinking is baked into everything we do, I couldn’t un-see it in my workplace. It’s how my company is able to extract so much from the employees at the bottom of the ladder and stamp out any chance of organizing.

I digress… on the positive side, I’m spending more time discovering my passions outside of work. Music has been really inspiring me and I’ve felt really called to pursue it more seriously. I also have been using my free time and money to build community and foster resilient connections that can withstand our nation’s fascist future.

My goal is to get to a place where I can log in and work for a few hours max, do my meetings and give good energy to my teammates (who desperately need it… everyone seems so miserable), bang out a few documents, and spend the rest of my time focusing on my music and honing in on my other skills (care work, writing, organizing, etc).

I’m so close to having this be a reality, but I feel like I’m energetically blocked by all my conditioning telling me that I have to be successful at this job. I’m always working with men who are way more invested in this company, and there’s a part of me that wants to prove them wrong and work harder to “show them.” That’s not really winning, though.

I feel like I’m carrying my team’s culture by 1) being one of two women, 2) being the youngest on my team and 3) actually engaging with people as humans instead of acting like a zombie. It’s so draining to show up in meetings when everyone else is so checked out and I’m wondering if it’s a waste of my energy. But I care about my teammates as people and don’t want to contribute to the negativity, so I am trying to build stronger boundaries there. I also have a specific coworker who really gets on my nerves that I work really closely with, and I’ve had a hard time setting boundaries with him.

I have this cycle that is fueled by an internal conflict: I don’t care about my job, I still show up, then I feel shame about not being productive enough (or any of the aforementioned problems triggers me), then I avoid work until a pressing deadline approaches, then I finally do the work that is asked of me, typically late and not well. It’s really draining and unsustainable and I don’t know how to kick it. I end up wasting so much time and energy just sitting on my computer and not doing anything out of avoidance of the bad feeling. My inner critic gets so loud and I judge myself for being unproductive when I consciously have chosen that I’m okay with being mediocre at this job. I grew up with an incredibly achievement-focused upbringing and that version of me is what got me this job in the first place. How do I unblock myself here?

I feel so isolated and alone because I feel like no one in this industry can relate to me. If they did, we certainly can’t talk about it because it goes against the patriarchal, white supremacist, capitalist values that are baked into the system. I’m not even trying to organize a union or anything, I just want to feel seen and heard. This industry is so toxic and I’m just trying to survive and make it work for me because I’m so lucky to even be here collecting this check as a queer Gen Z woman of color who came from a low-income background.

That was a lot and turned into more of a brain dump than a specific ask, but again, I’m open to hearing anyone’s wisdom — particularly if you’ve successfully maintained energetic boundaries in an environment that is so draining.

I’m a woman who has been in tech as a software engineer for over 10 years now, and I’m at a point where I want to start my own IT Consulting agency—a bold move that I like to think could rival Accenture one day! 😄 However, I’ve hit a few roadblocks along the way, especially when trying to find guidance.

I reached out to the Small Business Administration for help, but all the mentors available were men, and each conversation ended with them laughing off my idea or trying to convince me not to pursue it, citing the fact that I have a family and a current job.

I was also hoping to find a mentor on Veterati, but it has sadly shut down. Posting about this on LinkedIn crossed my mind, but my current workplace watches my profile like a hawk, and I’m on medical leave right now due to a mental breakdown caused by a pretty toxic environment. I’ve dealt with the typical issues—being a woman in a male-dominated field where we get a hard time, and all the usual stuff.

What I’m really looking to do is build a company and culture that is the exact opposite of what I’ve experienced. A space for women, neurodiverse individuals, and other underrepresented groups in tech. I want to create a workplace that values balance—where taking maternity or paternity leave doesn’t come with fear, where work ends when your kids get out of school, and where half-day Fridays and 4-day work weeks are options. A place that prioritizes happiness, health, and growth over burnout.

If we can foster a place where people are thriving and valued, I know that the business will thrive, too. 

So, here’s where I need help: I’d love to connect with other women in tech who have either started their own companies or have a passion for creating better workplaces. If anyone would be willing to chat—whether virtually over tea, or if I could treat you to lunch—about your journey and any advice you have, I’d really appreciate it. If you know someone who might be open to this, feel free to send them my way as well.

Any help, advice, or connections would mean the world to me. Thank you! ",user_703,9,11

I have consistently had the highest ratings possible, bonuses, raises, promotions for the past 5+ years.  Please be gentle.

I don't know where to start.  I last updated my resume over a decade ago and all I read about is how AI can screw you if you don't have your resume written correctly.  Are there professional resume writing services worth anything?  Also, I don't even know what to apply for at this point.

I've always been a ""database developer"" or ""database analyst"" by title, but my role has gone into more of a technical lead / architect role and I do very little of the day to day dev work anymore.  I make technical decisions, I direct my teammates' work, I support them with mentoring, training, writing technical requirements, helping them work through dev issues.  I am a liaison between dev and the business and other teams.  I am historically the SME on a data integration platform that supports hundreds of clients and dozens of apps at my company, but since it is quite mature and I have trained folks to do the (rather repetitive) work of implementations, I only do dev for major enhancements.

I was recently drafted to work on a second team/project migrating a system off of mainframe into modern tech.  I am doing DB design, creating the source control and deployment process and helping the application developers make design decisions.

In the past decade I have worked on projects like creating our application resiliency strategy (and then trained other teams in how to do it).  I migrated our source control from TFS to Git, trained my team (none of them knew Git and neither did I before this), developed the SDLC process for my team, trained other teams.  I also was build engineer since no one else wanted to help us migrate that part.  I redesigned the app I am SME on to be able to support more volume, spent a year building out the hardware and software so we could do onboarding for a huge F100 company.  I don't remember how many 10s of millions that deal was worth.

I constantly work across the company supporting other teams.  My job description is basically ""grab a shovel"".  I always say yes because I enjoy the challenge.  I tend to try to learn things as quickly as possible to smooth the way for others.  I know from experience that my level of problem solving skills and perseverance is not something the majority of people have.  I regularly have to learn tech I know nothing about in order to drive solutions.  I am more of a wide achiever than a deep achiever though I can go deep when need be.

But here I am.  And how the hell do I write a resume to convey ""I will learn whatever is necessary, train up everyone around me, go forth into your organization with best practices, and be a great resource when things hit the fan""?

What job am I even looking for?  Also, to be honest, I am dying working full time.  I don't wanna do this 40-50 hours a week thing anymore.  I am in my 40s now and so burnt out.

Also, I'm extremely physically unattractive and that is stressing me the hell out because I know how much that works against me in interviews.  I was literally in my 20s when I got this job.  I have not aged well.  I also do not know how well I would do in an extremely technical interview because I tend to forget a lot of details after a year or so when I have moved onto the next thing.  Do I remember all the merge types in Git anymore?  Nope.  Have I ever used a pivot table?  Nope.

I am kind of in shock right now but soon need to shift into gear and find a way out.

Any advice or commiseration would be welcome, especially on the resume/what kinds of jobs should I apply for question.  If you have made it this far, thanks for listening.",user_704,12,39

I just.... do I even like this industry enough to continue? I like coding, but I feel like expectations have changed drastically in the last year.  I wish I knew how to decide whether to leave tech or not.  I honestly don't know what else I would do, I've been doing it so long.

In my latest role, I’m a “BA/PM” (my bosses words, not mine) but my title is BA.  I report directly to an VP - there is no PO or PM above me.

Every Developer, QC and Sys Admin I’ve worked with has told me that I need to push for promotion. 

My boss is stating that the only way I will receive a promotion is by getting a PMP Cert. In fact, he told me that NO ONE will ever hire me as a project manager or product owner without a PMP. Basically, if I want to move up in any capacity, it’s a necessity.

I already know I need to leave this job because I have no future here. But is my boss correct? I feel so defeated and taken advantage of, being called a “PM” when my title says otherwise and doing a huge percentage of the job but being told a certificate is my only path forward in my career and no one else will hire me without one.

To be clear, I don’t know whether I’d want to become a PM or PO, but I feel like those paths are not even open to me in IT anymore. Without a bachelors I can’t even get a PMP, only a CAPM.

How do you negotiate pay?,"So, I know this is like a thing for people in the tech industry. I feel a bit like I need to rant, and I'm really unsure how to respond to the recruiter since this just happened.

I've been in variations of Sys admin roles since 2015, have certifications required for my client and recently started going to college for the first time. I've been working in an ISSO role for the past year since my last position/contract as ""Local Support/System Admin/Security and Then Some"" became too stressful to continue working in.

I've decided I'd rather get back into a more technical role (because lets me honest, writing papers and being in meetings all the time sucks) and applied internally to another position at the recommendation of a coworker who moved companies with me also due to the stressful environment. (Some vague background - co-worker is much younger than me (19-20 vs 32), 1.5 years experience in the field (not specifically related to the position he is currently in that I applied for), and is male).

As I applied for the position, I asked what he made since I'd like try to request at least that much considering I had limited experience with the product. He said 130k so I asked for 135-140k.

Certificates are required for this product which I have completed the basic and advanced training on.

I'm very happy for my co-worker. Don't get me wrong. I told him he's doing a great job and I'm happy he's making the money he makes at such a young age. He took my suggestion to go to college while he can seriously and is doing it. He's a bright person. It just really sucks to feel like I'm being underpaid.

I just received notification back that my offer was approved for 115k and I really just don't know what to say. I'm insulted and upset. Maybe I'm over-reacting?

I can't really think of a way to start negotiating for higher pay at this point other than to throw the knowledge I have of another, similar experienced person's pay from the same company out into the discussion table.

I don't know. I'm just so tired of being lowballed when it seems like my male counterparts aren't. Any advice is appreciated.",user_716,13,6

I just don’t know where to start my career story.
Ok I did engineering Computer Science and topped the university in 2007, just placed from campus in India. Loved C++ started working in Struts Java back then. I worked real hard for 1.5 years but as a girl born in India I was not allowed to live alone in a new city but kept on fighting and eventually gave up and resigned my first job. Now due to cultural and stupid social reasons I kept on waiting to get married, meanwhile I did MBA correspondence in IT. I finally got married in 2011. Now stage 2 struggle I applied to thousands of jobs but because I was technically out of touch and had a big gap in my career I failed thousand times, but eventually got a job in 2014. I was working from 2014 uptil my first pregnancy in 2017. I was in UAE that time and had multiple miscarriages as well due to genetic issues I had 4 miscarriages before my first daughter was born in 2017. Anyways my husband wanted to move to Australia so I resigned again from my job. I was in Australia in 2017 now, 4 more miscarriages and thousand more failed interviews later, I did AWS certification during that time. I got another job when my second daughter was born in 2021. Now I was working remotely while taking care of both my children and struggling to stay alive.
I worked in my previous company till 2024 and resigned again to come back to UAE.
And here I am again with both my daughters in school this year I am again failing learning depressed don’t know what to start where to start.
I had worked in Struts Swing JSF Spring AWS Angular JS during my active career years but feels like I know nothing now. I feel like a complete failure all the time. plus I just can’t take care of my children 24*7 which my husbands expects me to as he is extremely busy with his job. He says I wanted children so I should not expect a break also when we are fighting he hurts me a lot by saying I have no passion no commitment to study and crack the interviews I still get. Yes I sleep a lot I actually don’t sleep at night anymore I sleep the whole time my daughters are at school plus he is at office he says all I care is to sleep. I just need myself back somehow I just need to earn money somehow. 
Ok that was really long rant. My life is a waste it’s a series of failed interviews. My CV says I know a lot but actually I know nothing at all. I tried doing udemy courses I tried building React js TODO apps I tried everything but should I give up now.

I work full time in IT but also go to school for cybersecurity and am the president of the cybersecurity club. I am the only female member of leadership. I'm experiencing issues with our new faculty advisor and I fear that my gender is the cause of it. 

She is a woman too however she recently told me 1 on 1 that she is much harsher and not as helpful to her female students as she is to her male ones. She said that she needs to build their character if they're going to make it in the industry. I disagree with that, I do think character is needed but that it isn't appropriate for her to treat her students differently based on their gender. 

I also believe this thinking of hers could be the cause of issues I'm experiencing in the club. I' being left out of club decisions and leadership discussions. Decisions I make are being overridden by her. Input I give is ignored. 

My problem is I'm not sure if I should go to our other faculty advisor with these issues or if it even is something worth reporting. On one hand, the other advisor is her superior and I trust him, I know he would do something about this if I told him. But on the other, I was planning on stepping down as president after this semester anyways and her husband is currently the professor of an important class I'm in. I think I am also the only student who has experienced these issues with her and have no concrete evidence.

I am considering going back to school for an MBA and ran across the Cornell Tech-focused MBA.  It looks like its an MBA program with some introductory tech-focused courses to give the student a baseline level of technical knowledge.  Here are some of the details of the Cornell program vs the program I was planning to take.

Cornell Tech MBA:  [https://studentaffairs.tech.cornell.edu/academics/curriculum/johnson-cornell-tech-mba/](https://studentaffairs.tech.cornell.edu/academics/curriculum/johnson-cornell-tech-mba/)

CSU Global MBA: [https://csuglobal.edu/academic-programs/graduate-degrees/master-business-administration](https://csuglobal.edu/academic-programs/graduate-degrees/master-business-administration)

The Cornell MBA seems to have some good courses that would be of benefit to a person without a technical background, however I do have a technical background and a degree in computer science.  I liked the CSUG degree because it is affordable (675$ per course) and its 100% online.  

My intentions for getting an MBA are to put something on my resume that would set me apart from my peers in consideration for a management position.  I don't want to be a product/project manager but I would like to be considered for a role as a manager for a technical team.

I have my bachelors in EE, work in the renewable energy field and really love it. I have found myself thriving in the Sales Engineer role/career path. 

the way I see it is I get to use my engineer degree/background while also supporting customers and working on really cool projects. 

I also find it really motivating to get a bonus based on successful project bids. It’s a high I like to chase, sue me! (Jk) 

So I have found myself really enjoying the business side of my role. Getting my engineering degree was really hard, I found a lot of the concepts didn’t come to me naturally (hence why I’m not on the design side). So I would like to pivot to an MBA to complement my background. 

Do you think it’s worth pursing it? I want to get some sort of higher level of education. 

Anyone else have gotten their MBA? What’s your experience been? 

I don’t mean to sound so naive , I have just seen a lot of negative sentiment around “MBAs” ruining companies. 

I should note that I have 7+ years professional experience, not a fresh grad.


Thank you ladies!

I really want to continue working in this sector because I enjoy building products and love learning. I just hate how hard it is to get in and find the right team. My first couple of experiences really really destroyed my self esteem - belief in my ability to do the job.


Right now everyone in my life is suggesting  


I go back to school - Nursing in particular because it is stable. I don’t want to do because … ugh, I don’t want to be a Nurse. Am I wrong for wanting to do work that I actually enjoy?

Hey everyone,I’m feeling a bit discouraged and could use some advice. I was laid off from my first job out of college about two months ago(sadly due to performance). I have nearly two years of experience as a Software Engineer, but the team environment at my previous job was extremely stressful and not a good fit for me.

Now, I’m trying to figure out my next steps. I definitely want to land another software engineering job—I do have some interviews lined up, which is promising. However, I’ve also been contemplating other potential paths. I'm not entirely sure what I could pivot to, but I want to explore all my options. For those of you who have been in a similar situation, how did you navigate it? What steps did you take to secure another role despite the current market conditions?(Perfectly aware of the tech market conditions)
Do you think someone with close to 2YOE can land another SWE job sometime soon? 

I’m open to any advice or insights you might have. I guess I just need some encouragement and practical steps during this time.

I have a master’s degree and >10 years of professional experience, much of that working as a high level analyst in academia and leading projects and supervising people. I do things like spatial statistics, dashboards, analytical data visualization type work. And I’m…really, really good at it.

In my industry (amongst peers outside my organization) I feel admired and respected, but in my agency I have been facing some boys club bs, guys that have been arrogant and patronizing to me increasingly over time. They did a lot of white knight behavior when I was new, and I’ve watched them run away from me in slow motion as I’ve remained outspoken and assertive in meetings. Now I’m getting excluded more and more.

Fortunately I was just added to a new group in my agency for online analytics and I offered to present on spatial analytics, ArcGIS applications, and provide a demo for a meeting next month. This group is run by female managers, but they’re not my managers.

In this new group I was added to, I’m the only GIS person there. Everyone else is SQL or SAS people trying to take on tableau and power BI. Some of the boys club programmers are part of this group and they’ve been acting smug so far. I also have tableau and use it a bit, but I honestly think ArcGIS can do everything those platforms do, and more. I haven’t showed them that yet though. I’m now ready to, and will have the opportunity soon…hehe

However a colleague got in my head because she’s older and has been here a while. In preparation for this upcoming presentation, she recommended I kowtow for a bit to ingratiate myself. but then came back to me a couple days later and said actually OP you’re great, just be you. So I remain confused.

I think the responsibility is on me to show what GIS can do, but how would you take an opportunity like that to shine as bright as possible? My gut is telling me to focus on the most analytical things you can do in GIS apps and nowhere else. I want more opportunities to shine, but I do not want to kowtow.

What would you recommend I do to slay this presentation?",user_64,11,9

I am currently a manager in a creative industry, have an Arts degree and one young child. My partner is a software engineer with a degree, ideally I would like to avoid an expensive and time consuming degree (I’m still paying off my first) but willing to study and he assures me that a Uni degree isn’t strictly needed to get a foot in. I’d be taking a substantial drop in seniority (which is fine, better to be at the bottom of a ladder you want and all that) but even though my partner is supportive and offering guidance, the industry feels so huge? Overwhelming but also exciting. 

Ultimately my motivation is financial security for myself and my family. My current industry has huge cultural significance but is known for paying poorly and long term, my focus and goal is saving saving saving money. 

Some thoughts I have - 

How to establish where I am best suited and how my transferable skills are best utilised. I see PM work being a natural fit perhaps, I am used to PM work just not in tech fields. Has anyone found talking to a careers advisor useful? 

How realistic is part time / remote working for a junior? Is this for tenured staff only? 

Has anyone forgone the Uni route and still made their way in?

I recently graduated with a BA in Business Administration with a focus on Tourism Management. During my time at uni, I discovered an interest for Natural Language Processing (NLP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML).

Since then, I've been self-teaching and have developed a good grasp of programming and coding fundamentals. Although I'm confident in my skills, I feel that having a formal degree in Computer Science (CS) or Software Engineering (SWE) would look good on my resume and give me boost, especially given the current competitive job market in tech.

I’ve found some reputable online programs for both CS and SWE, but I'm unsure which path would be more beneficial for my career goals in NLP, AI, and ML.

I’ve had several meetings with my manager where I’ve asked about a promotion, and have been told a few things over the course of the last 9 months or so. It’s not in the budget, next year she’ll throw my name in the ring, the department is not planning on backfilling any senior positions (our attrition is high), it’s almost impossible to get a promotion on the same team at this company (which isn’t true, I have several peers who started the same time I did who were promoted within their teams), etc etc. 

I’ve been looking at internal positions within my company because of this. There are next to zero. I found one I was interested in and applied, had a couple interviews that went well, and then they decided they weren’t going to fill that position. Back at square one. 

I’ve asked my manager multiple times what I can do to ensure I get a promotion next cycle. The only feedback she can give is to keep doing what I’m doing, and that I’m doing everything right. 

I have connected with a mentor at the senior director level, and I’m looking for any advice on how to get the most out of this situation. I feel so stuck. I applied for external positions for 8-9 months straight and was almost entirely ghosted. I want to grow my career and expand my knowledge, but I’m not being given the opportunity.

My colleague and I work in IT for our organization, and we’ve always struggled with a lack of resources. We handle day-to-day IT issues, admin tasks, and larger initiatives, and up until July, we had an IT director and a small team, but they were laid off, leaving just the two of us to manage everything.  
  
Recently, after repeatedly asking for help, our HR rep **suggested we bring on an intern through a Canadian internship program**. Our COO approved it, so we’ve started the hiring process and have a few interviews lined up. Initially, we thought this intern could help us with some lower-level, time-consuming tasks (like managing access permissions), freeing us up to focus on critical projects.  
  
Here’s where we’re struggling: now that we’ve thought it through, **we realize that interns, especially unpaid ones, expect meaningful learning experiences—not just “grunt work.”** We’re ethical people and don’t feel right about offloading the more mundane tasks without offering substantial development opportunities in return. Plus, we’re starting to worry that onboarding, mentoring, and **managing an intern might actually add to our workload instead of reducing it**. We're **worried that the investment in a short term intern (3-6 months) won't be worth it** compared to a paid employee (that we've repeatedly struggled to get approval for).  
  
To complicate things, our **COO has expectations for this intern that seem more appropriate for a paid, long-term employee**, which has us feeling even more anxious and gives me the ""ick"", personally. We don’t want to backtrack and look unprofessional by pulling the plug now that we’ve posted the position and scheduled interviews. But at the same time, we fear this could backfire and make our lives even more stressful. Things are already really bad :(  
  
We’re **seeking advice on how to proceed:**  
  
• Should we raise a red flag and rethink the internship before it’s too late?  
• Is there a way to make this work without overwhelming ourselves or exploiting the intern?  
• What would be a realistic way to manage an unpaid IT intern while still maintaining our sanity?

on friday, i followed up with her assistant to let her know that im mid-stage with 2 other opportunities and to ask if they had any more information on next steps. still no response. 

my husband thinks i should put a deck together outline what i would do in my first 90 days for them. i am totally down to do this, but i worry that it will come off as arrogant and completely presumptuous rather than self-starting and proactive. 

alternatively, im inclined to follow up with the CEO directly since we already emailed, and since she is who interviewed me, but I also know that a follow up likely won't sway the decision at all. 

so my question to my fellow women in tech:

1. deck - yea or nay

2. follow up w CEO?

3. do nothing


this is a senior level product role at a small company.

My backstory: I've been unemployed for 6 months (left on my own accord after getting divorced) and have now been asked in every single late stage interview (4) to prepare a presentation based on a real problem the company is facing. The thing is, I have the time and nothing to lose doing the free work, BUT it just feels sooo icky to me, especially because the problems are REAL and not some made up situation. I'm also especially frustrated because after my most recent presentation I was told that they've ""deprioritized the role due to changes in strategy"". WTH!

So, I’ve been working on this massive project for the past year—it’s a complex system optimization that I designed and implemented from scratch. It was a nightmare to build, but it’s now saving the company thousands of hours and a ton of money. Everyone knows it’s my baby.  

Enter: Brad. Brad joined the team six months ago and has been… fine. Not great, not terrible, just fine. Last week, we hit a snag where the system started throwing errors during peak usage. I immediately identified the issue (a memory leak caused by an edge case I hadn’t accounted for) and spent two sleepless nights fixing it. I documented everything, tested it thoroughly, and pushed the fix.  

Cut to the next team meeting. Brad, who had *nothing* to do with the fix, stands up and starts explaining the problem and how he “led the effort” to resolve it. He even used my slides and diagrams without crediting me. My manager, who was in the room, nodded along like Brad was some kind of genius. At the end of his presentation, the team gave him a *standing ovation.* A STANDING OVATION.  

I was too stunned to say anything in the moment, but afterward, I pulled my manager aside and explained that it was my work. Their response? “Well, Brad did a great job presenting it, and it’s good for team morale to celebrate wins together.”  

I’m so beyond frustrated. Brad is now being fast-tracked for a leadership role, and I’m being told to “keep up the good work.” Am I overreacting, or is this as insane as it feels? Should I quit, go to HR, or just start forwarding Brad’s emails to the entire company with corrections?

I put in extra hours, volunteered for everything, and got praised as a top performer. But instead of rewards, I got more work, more stress, and watched people who did less climb the ladder. I finally hit a wall. The urgent-but-not-really requests, the endless meetings, the performative grind - it all started feeling pointless. I wasn’t saving lives, yet people acted like we were launching rockets to Mars. My motivation tanked, and suddenly, I wasn’t the star player anymore. Just another employee doing their job. And honestly? That realization almost broke me.

Now, I'd like to share the most impactful 5 lessons I’ve learned, along with thoughtful summaries of the chapters that resonated with me most:

**- Your body may stuck in an incomplete stress cycle (""**[**Burnout""**](https://befreed.ai/book/burnout-by-emily-nagoski) **by Emily and Amelia Nagoski)**

These twin sisters (one a health educator, one a conductor) blend science and compassion to explain why women experience burnout differently. Their explanation of ""human giver syndrome"" hit me like a truck - finally understood why I felt obligated to overperform. Here’s a quote from the summary of the most impactful chapter about burnout caused by social expectation in society: ""the authors introduce the concept of 'Human Giver Syndrome,' where women are expected to be caregivers, always putting others' needs before their own. This syndrome is deeply rooted in societal expectations that women must be pretty, happy, calm, generous, and attentive to others, never ugly, angry, upset, ambitious, or attentive to their own needs."" 

**- Act like a leader, not a worker ( ""**[**Executive Presence**](https://befreed.ai/book/executive-presence-by-sylvia-ann-hewlett)**"" by Sylvia Ann Hewlett**) 

A Harvard researcher breaks down what actually gets people promoted. Spoiler: It’s not hard work, it’s how you present yourself. Below is a key quote from the summary that provided the actual strategies on how to enhance my communication skills: 

""First, work on your speaking skills. This includes your grammar, accent, and the timbre and pitch of your voice. Practice speaking clearly and confidently, varying your tone to keep your audience engaged.

Second, learn to read the room. Pay attention to non-verbal cues and adjust your communication style accordingly. This skill is particularly important in diverse, global environments.

Third, master the art of storytelling. People remember stories far more than they remember facts and figures. Use anecdotes and examples to illustrate your points and make your message more memorable.

Lastly, don't underestimate the power of listening. Good communication is a two-way street. Show genuine interest in what others have to say, ask thoughtful questions, and demonstrate that you value their input.""

**- Detach from validation (""**[**The Mountain Is You**](https://befreed.ai/book/the-mountain-is-you-by-brianna-wiest)**"" by Brianna Wiest**)

A deep dive into self-sabotage and why we tie our self-worth to external achievements. This one hit me hard. Really love this book and this author. 

**- Stop delivering early ( ""The 48 Laws of Power"" by Robert Greene**)

This book, a cult classic on strategy and influence, taught me that overperformance can be a trap. Delivering work ahead of schedule only increases expectations: pace yourself.

**- Use strategic incompetence (""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck"" by Mark Manson**)

 A blunt, hilarious guide to letting go of what doesn’t serve you. One lesson? If you’re too good at something you hate, pretend you’re bad at it.

Now I do my job well, but I don’t overextend. I don’t chase gold stars. I leave on time. And for the first time in years, I don’t feel guilty about it. If you’re burning out, know this: You don’t owe your soul to a company. Work is just work. ",user_769,3281,151

Why do people think men are smart just because they are overly confident?  

Let me share my experience observing men and their behavior. Many of them were considered successful, they were business owners at 25, startup founders, or had impressive careers.  

At first, when I worked and interacted with them, I felt inferior. Their image and achievements suggested they must be incredibly intelligent and successful.  

But when I had the chance to get to know them closely and talk with them, I observed one thing, they were all overly confident, to the point that they often said stupid things without realizing they were wrong.  

In fact, interacting with these so-called ""successful"" men actually made me more confident. Listening to them and watching them in action, I noticed a shocking level of ignorance, shallowness, lack of critical thinking, and poor judgment.  

A large part of their success is just an illusion. Before meeting them, I assumed they must be highly intelligent because they had achieved so much at a young age. But in reality, their attitude was more like overconfident students, self-absorbed and unaware of their own mistakes. I often found myself thinking, I’m actually smarter than them.  Why was I so worried and insecure about myself when I found them to be nothing special? It was a huge confidence boost for me, seeing that their image as genius entrepreneurs was just a facade.

The difference between me and them, I wasn’t as confident. They thrived in their ""bro circles,"" hyping each other up. Every single one of them thought they were the next Elon Musk. In their minds, they saw themselves as visionaries, entrepreneurs, and entitled geniuses.  

Unfortunately, many people, especially those without real insight or expertise, fail to see through this illusion. They mistake confidence for intelligence. In reality, these men often have terrible ideas, but they push them forward because they influence others with their ego and presence.  

It happened to me that I worked with a group of tech bros on an innovative tool. I talked to them and listened to their ideas for the solution. Most of their ideas were shallow and poorly thought out. When I tried to suggest a better idea, they ignored me and insisted on going with their own approach.  

Later, when we presented the solution to more knowledgeable people, they pointed out the exact same flaws I had warned about. I couldn't help but feel that if they had only listened to me, the project would have been a success. Of course, they didn’t even remember that I had suggested that solution earlier.  

They are a group of overconfident men, often lacking creativity. They design solutions as they are self-centered, with little consideration for clients' needs. Their understanding of users is minimal, and their creativity is weak. Overconfident and self-absorbed, they are definitely not as smart as they present themselves to be.  

And in a patriarchal society, a male entrepreneur is automatically considered smart. A woman, people are skeptical.  
When a man presents an idea, people associate him with the next Elon Musk, the next ""tech bro genius,"" just because he's male. There’s a huge bias in favor of men, which makes them seem far more intelligent than they actually are.  

Ladies, I highly recommend being more confident in yourselves. Don't be fooled by the illusion of male competence. Confidence isn’t the same as intelligence.

Programs like federal student loans and Pell Grants may shift to the Treasury, while special education (IDEA) could move to Health and Human Services, and vocational programs to the Department of Labor.

Legislative Push for Full Abolition: Congress will be urged to pass legislation formally dissolving ED. However, this requires bipartisan support, which is unlikely given opposition from Democrats and some Republicans.

The administration has set a proposed termination date of December 31, 2026, for the department.

Staff Reductions and Program Cuts: Dozens of ED employees, particularly those involved in diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, have been placed on administrative leave as part of broader restructuring efforts. Funding for discretionary programs may be frozen or redirected.

I have been searching for 15 months for my next position and I have gotten shot down every single time. I have had a good amount of first round interviews and I have made it to the final round 4 times only to be told no or we can't hire anyone right now. 

My savings is running out and what I make a the gas station barely covers anything. It isn't enough to keep going like this. It is unsustainable. I am scared that I am going to end up on the streets. I am trying everything I can to avoid it but it seems no one will listen when I tell them I can do the damn job. They all just ignore me and look at someone else. 

I am scared. I have tried everything to get a job. I have learned new skills, I have updated my resume 10+ times, I have networked my ass off only for everyone to fall short of getting me that offer, I have worked on personal projects to show I am not staying stagnant, I have tried to freelance but never been able to secure a single client ( I have been on upwork and fiverr and got nothing. I have also tried doing it in person and still nothing), I have gone out for contracts only to get rejected from those. 

I don't know what else to do other than keep trying the same shit that isn't working. I have no family to fall back on. I am running out of options and I am terrified.

I did everything you are told to do growing up yet I am still in this situation. 

Update 1: It might be too early to give and update but so far I have gotten a couple leads and had some conversations with people. I did completely bomb one interview and I am kicking myself for it. I don't want to say too much yet.

Edit: I know everyone is trying to help but please stop suggesting teacher. I have looked and everything around me either wants you to have a teachers license, WHICH I DO NOT HAVE. I don't have the money to go back to school and get one.

Update 2: sitting in my car in a panic attack. 

Update 3: I got a freelance contract! It's not for a lot of money and short term but it's something! Thank you, everyone! Also, the fight isn't over yet! Any ideas or anyone who needs a developer send them my way! ",user_85,2654,345

I didn’t come into tech the traditional way. I started out as an administrative assistant—smart, hungry, always trying to get a foot in the door to do the work, not just support the people doing it. I worked at a defense contractor, then commercial real estate. Everyone kept telling me how bright my future was, how I had “project manager energy,” etc., but somehow, the promotions never came. I was stuck as a high-level EA, no matter how capable I was.

Eventually, I decided to stop waiting for recognition and just applied to every well-reviewed company in my area. Admin work can get your foot in the door anywhere. That’s how I landed at a top 10 biopharma company—supporting a senior executive who happened to be a progressive, openly gay man. He was one of the few who actually mentored me, gave me real autonomy, and saw my potential. He told me he’d manage his own calendar—he wanted me to work with his leadership team and find where I could make an impact.

That’s how I met the head of oncology, who eventually offered me an entry-level project management role. The work was highly technical, and HR required a master’s degree in science or engineering—but I had a master’s in education from an earlier career detour, so that technically checked the box. I crushed the interviews and was offered the role.

Here’s where it gets infuriating: the salary range posted for the role would’ve given me at least a 50% raise. But HR refused to give me even the lowest end of the range because, and I quote, “We can’t give someone a 50% raise.” So they gave me a good raise—but one that was still way below what someone in that role should’ve earned.

My new boss was livid. She tried to make it right. She gave me the biggest raise she could, and as a workaround, paid me out a massive bonus—2.5x my target—to bring me closer to where I should’ve been. She did this again the next year, and the next, until after four years, my salary finally caught up to my peers.

You’d think this is a win, right? Not really. Because those four years of underpayment didn’t just hurt me then—they hurt me for years afterward. Every job offer after that was based on a salary history that was artificially low. Bonuses don’t show up on offer letters. And because I stayed at that company for seven years, the compounding loss was massive.

Why did this happen? Because I came from a “pink collar” job. Because I was an admin, a role overwhelmingly filled by women, my entry point into tech was penalized—even when I moved into a technical, male-dominated function. I broke the glass ceiling, sure—but the shards cut me for years.

I know I’m not alone in this. I know so many women have stories like this—especially those who came into tech through non-traditional paths. I just wanted to share mine in case someone else out there is feeling the same thing: that even when you win, the system finds ways to keep you just a little behind.

Big man's toying with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. If you like having your own home and control of your finances, take notice.

1. You may now discriminate against people for all of the usual reasons so long as you don't do so *overtly*. ""Disparate impact"" is no longer a consideration. If you were looking forward to a raise or promotion, curb your excitement. 
2. Enforcement of relevant cases is being intentionally ""deprioritized"".
3. Pam Bondi and Sam Adolphsen are going to, somewhere in the next 30 days, tell the president how to get around existing federal and state regulations pertaining to this.
4. The new standard of ""It's only discriminatory if it claims to be"" will be applied (within 45 days) by Pam Bondi and Andrea Lucas to everything within their jurisdictions. Same goes for Scott Turner, Russel Vought, & Andrew Ferguson. for credit access, housing, and ""laws prohibiting unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices"". 
5. Within 90 days, this will also go for existing consent judgements and permanent injunctions. 
6. Finally, Pam is going to figure out how the Federal government can prevent U.S States from enforcing laws against this kind of discrimination, and she and Andrea will put out guidebooks on ""How not to be discriminatory"" for employers.

This person doesn’t take feedback well and vacillates btw being defensive and completely stonewalling me over simple requests and inquiries.  Last week, he insinuated that the institution was better before I arrived and that I wasn’t effective at my job.  Absolutely wild stuff.  Today during our one on one, I read him the riot act.  It took him completely off guard and he did a complete 180, backtracking that I had misunderstood his comments.  I calmly reminded him who I was, what my charge is and how I would not tolerate further instances where our interactions are marked by a disrespectful tone or thinly veiled insults.  One of my favorite lines that I borrowed from here was “When did I give you the impression that these comments would be appropriate things to say to me?”  The look on this man’s face.

I’m 35, have a master’s degree, a professional license, and I work in state govt, for context. I’m a talented analyst. I am excelling in my role, I successfully accused a former boss of hostile work environment and I won. Because I proved it. But I also had to advocate for myself and be flashy.

If you are good at your job, people are going to notice. If you’re ambitious and driven, they’ll notice. If you happen to be attractive on top of that, oh you’ll get noticed.

My advice:


- know the 48 laws of power. This will help you see when people are trying to manipulate you and help you work around it.

- you need to be ok with being disliked or envied. It’s just going to happen, no need to take it personally.

- if you’re up for it, get popular. Network internally and externally. Get known by other teams in your organization as being helpful and collaborative. If you get known for your skills, it will make it difficult for manipulators to have a leg to stand on when they play games.

- Pretty privilege is real, for better or worse. I’m a head turner so if it gets folks paying attention to me when ultimately I want to talk about data, I’m just glad people are hearing about the data!

- psychological safety in the workplace is so important. Take note of people around you that make you feel safe. Hopefully your direct supervisor falls under this. If not, your mental health may suffer.

- similarly, it helps to have an internal mentor or someone with clout looking out for you. Showing off your skill when high ups are around will help make this happen.

- know what your job is, do that job undeniably well, and be sure to communicate your results on record. 

- lean into any skills you have that mediocre white guys won’t likely be good at. Things like communication, organization, just don’t do admin/glue work. Show off that beautiful code you wrote and make sure they know it was written by you. Document your workflows and tactfully roll some out.

- it’s not arrogance if you can back up what you say. That’s just competence. Show off the competence you have.

- manage up judiciously. Make your boss’s job easier if you know they’ve got your back. Do not manage up if you don’t trust a situation, just do YOUR job.

- beware insecure men. They might seem nice and complimentary but if you know you’re talented, wait until insecure men come to understand this before you say too much around them. My boss told me one of my male peers is scared of me. As my therapist says, ‘that’s a him problem, not a me problem.’

- by default, coworkers are not friends. I’ve made real friends from work in the past but it took years to build trust. Everyone is ultimately out for themselves in the workplace.

- protect your energy. Communicate firm boundaries with a smile. Only you control how you react to things.

- find a good therapist if you can afford it. You’ll need it!",user_64,1459,111

Everything seemed to be going ok…*until* I started succeeding. *Until* I started getting recognized and given more responsibility. Then there was a massive shift, practically overnight. 

All of a sudden they started treating me with attitude. Acting annoyed when I had a question. Not listening to me or responding to my communications. Silently pushing me out of important conversations and sidelining me. And at times, treating me with contempt, like I was some kind of joke. 

Some of these men I thought I really got on well with, too. I didn’t “trust” them per se, but I trusted that there was respect there. I let down my guard because of this. And I couldn’t have been more foolish, apparently. 

It’s been a sickening realization that they never actually respected me, they only “liked” me when they perceived me as beneath them. Once I really started to demonstrate value, they turned on me in the blink of an eye, with zero remorse.

But I wanted to share what it has been like being in tech for 35 yrs.  I am 57 now and feel like I am ready to peace out.

I attended a technical high school where I was the only female in the data processing/programming track; the other females took data entry. I learned to program in RPG-II on punched cards using an IBM 1140 in the early to mid 80s.

At 16, I was assigned to convert my entire school district's attendance and grading system from the IBM 1140 to a System 36. I served as the lead student programmer.

At 17, I enrolled in a technical college specializing in engineering, where 85% of the students were male. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in just 2.5 years.

By 21, I entered the IT professional world. In my very first week, my boss asked how long it would be before I had children—because, in his mind, that was inevitable since I was married. Within a year, I redesigned the company’s sales reporting system to use SQL-based languages at a time when SQL was still very new. I faced constant bullying from male colleagues who were intimidated by a young woman outperforming and reshaping their world.

Eventually, I left and became a consultant. I was given explicit dress code guidelines: a gray or black pencil skirt, a red, white, or gray silk blouse, a tailored jacket, and high-heeled, closed-toe shoes. This dress code was enforced even though I was automating factories and had to walk across elevated grates where my heels would get stuck—often with men standing below, whistling as they looked up my skirt.  The 80’s and 90’s were definitely the wild west for women in Tech.  One time I was paid a bonus to stand in front of a booth at a trade show for the software I wrote with the paid models.  I was very thin (thanks 80s anorexia) and considered attractive.  I did it partly because I thought it funny when the men would come up to talk about the software they almost fell over to find out I wrote it.

Beyond the dress code, I also experienced blatant harassment. I have been pushed against a wall with a hand up my shirt and a tongue forced down my throat. I have had a boss stand behind my chair and grind against my back. In that environment, having my ass grabbed was considered a ""compliment.""  All the while I kept my head down and stayed true to my geek self and soldiered on.  Going to HR was a joke. 

I did have my son at 26, and 3 months later my husband was diagnosed with cancer.  So I worked brutal hours, took care of him and an infant while battling the blatant sexism.  All the men I worked with had stay at home wives, so they didn’t have to worry about how many hours they worked or cooking dinner or cleaning and picking up the kids.  When I was on call on Mothers Day no one would switch with me because they had to be there for their wives. 

I became a DBA at 28 and did that gig on various databases for 27 years.  I was a senior engineer with a team of 8 men.  Some of the men were great and we had a fantastic working relationship.  Others did everything they could to try to undercut me.

I have seen the workplace go from wink-wink, nudge-nudge while bosses and coworkers harassed women to where we were finally at least somewhat protected.  I have fought and clawed my way through the swamp of IT for 35 years.  I am currently in charge of converting a hospital systems EDW from cloud-based SQL server to Databricks.  The project is scheduled to be completed in 12 months.  I am back to working ungodly hours and getting treated like shit. 

Yesterday I lost it.  I almost rage quit after having my new manager imply that I wasn’t working hard  or doing enough.  I said a bunch of stuff and basically said “Take my title, take money back from my salary, I DON’T CARE.  I am the only one who has been involved in all aspects of the conversion, and I am the technical lead and now you want me to take confront co-workers aside and talk to them about their behavior?  I am not HR.  I have been technical only for 35 years BY CHOICE.”   
 And I still may face repercussions. You know what?  I don’t care.  I think I am finally at the end out my rope with the things going on in the world and especially regarding how I see women being viewed.  I am off today on a much-needed mental health day.

They will be so screwed if I leave.  I have no plans to find other employment other than maybe a fun part time job.  I don’t know for sure if I will leave, but I am leaning that way.  It kind of sucks too, because I know that I am good at what I do and I do like what I do. 

To all you young women in IT.  I am sorry.  I feel like we came so far and now the rug is being pulled out.  Somehow things may swing back but be prepared to push back your sleeves and keep your head down and show them regardless of what they throw at you.  


*** Update, as I expected, I have a ""performance"" meeting scheduled for next week now.

Maybe they will do me a favor and fire me.  I know they won't because I hold too much knowledge.  But maybe they will tip me over to put in a notice.
I am debating on asking that my managers manager be there.  I was very clear with HIM before this manager took over that would not do any type of HR type of employee confrontations. He was fine with that and told me that I should focus on what I do best which is build out this new platform.  I likely will do that becuase frankly I have nothing to lose and I do not like this manager's way of acting petulant.

On a happy note, my mental health day was very nice.  I knitted and spun yarn and walked my dogs.  And today my 2 rescue dogs passed their 3 odor recognition tests.  We have been training for this for a year!",user_795,1355,108

I have a gender-neutral name (it can be a male or female name) and I have had people address me as “he” until they see that I am visibly female. 

So I joined the Zoom interview and one of the two interviewers was already in the call. It took a minute for my video to load and the interviewer greeted me with a happy “hello! Nice to meet you.” I said hello, and apologized for the delay in the video. We exchanged a few pleasantries. When my video came on, his shoulders visibly slumped and I could swear I heard a sigh. He went from happy and friendly to completely passive aggressive. I tried to make conversation while waiting for the other interviewer, but he said “let’s just wait for the other interviewer.” When the other interviewer joined he apologized for being late and asked if the passive aggressive interviewer had introduced himself. I said no, we were waiting for you, to which he seemed visibly annoyed but then pressed ahead with the interview. I wasn’t getting much from the passive aggressive interviewer, even when I asked him a direct question. I left thinking “this is going to be a rejection.”

A few days later, I received a rejection saying that while the one interviewer really liked me, the passive aggressive interviewer thought I “didn’t have enough credibility.” I was interviewing for a job that was half a step down from my current position, but the role is in a field where others have considered me an “expert.” I have done tremendous practical work in said field, in addition to conducting research and making numerous publications. So unless he was expecting a Nobel Prize winner, I certainly had enough credibility.

This has happened to me before, where people seem friendly over email then enter into a call or an in-person meeting and act completely different, almost treating me with disdain. I am a pretty average looking woman and I don’t have any distinguishing features. I’ve even stopped wearing anything other than navy blue or black so that people don’t take offense to colored clothing. I have a frequent research collaborator who is trans and she has experienced the same, although for her there’s often outright hostility which makes me very sad. I also feel like it’s gotten worse over the past 5 years, whereas before I didn’t experience it as much, and that I’ve experienced this behavior the most from Indian men.  

Has anyone else experienced the same? If so, how do you cope?",user_49,1255,124

He told us he just went to another restaurant next to the one we were going the night before. I instantly felt odd about it cause most of the people in my age group or older do not go to that area unless it’s necessary, but I did not think too much about it at that very moment.

Right after my husband and I got out of our car, immediately, we saw all the young college kids walking around, college girls dressing up about to go to dinners or parties.

A little bit of the background introduction about my tech bro friend. He has 3 kids who he never lived together with from his 3 previous relationships and one of them is in college herself. He has worked for half of the FAANG companies as a software developer for the past 10 years (he was working as a bartender, cook and warehouse worker the first 15 years of his career).

Anyhow, right after we sat down, instead of chatting with us (his friends), he started flirting with our server who was a sophomore in college. He literally flirted with her the entire time we were dining in the restaurant. 

Upon bringing our credit cards back, the sweet, young and naive server told him he could follow her on instagram to stay in touch.

Before we left the restaurant, he made a comment about the server, “She is going to go really far. I mean really far” with a smile I would never forget.

I felt like to vomit.



Edit 1: I forgot to point out. Not only his flirting with the young college girl made me sick, the fact that he said that girl would go really far in her career made me really angry (not because she was bad or anything). As someone whose promotion got passed onto incapable male coworkers a few times in my career and received some unfair performance review comments throughout the years, I am angry of how men assess women’s abilities, skills and success. It’s truly sick.

Edit 2: someone asks in a comment why I pointed out his blue collar working history. Honestly, I listed only to because 1. he’s a middle-aged man. 2. but he only has 10 years of tech experience (less than 10 years actually). I just assumed people would ask what he was doing before joining tech, so I listed out his previous job history.

Edit 3: We are not actually friends 🤣. We met him at a church years ago while he was still with his third kid’s mom. Then we moved across the country last year. He happens to live in the same state as us now, so we thought why not having a dinner and catch up again. I will 100% keep my husband and my kids away from him from now on.

Edit 4: though I felt cringey that people put so much focus on whether the server was “naive” or not (I thought most of those commenters were men, but turned out some of them were women according to their posts history), I would like to address it here by providing more details. 

First of all the server looked like she was only 15, baby face and mentioned several times about her parents, siblings and cousins. She mentioned she was a sophomore, so that made her either 19 or 20 years old.  She was extremely sweat and polite that I could see hopes for the world in her eyes.

And to clarify the situation even more, my “friend” was flirting with her, but she was not flirting with him in any sense. From my observation, she was just trying to do her job. I really felt like she didn’t realize (or was a bit confused about) the old man in front of her was trying to flirt with her, she probably thought he was just a nice old guy.

I felt sick because this was not the first time I witnessed this kind of behavior from men. There was one time back in college I was waiting for my friend at a Starbucks near the campus. A middle-age men came to me asking what I studied for and then told me he was a CTO in a well-known company that he could get me an internship. I gave him my number right before my friend arrived at the coffee shop. The next day, that old guy texted me complaining about his wife and asked if I was interested in having a dinner with him. I instantly blocked that number. 

Same story 15 years apart. Yet I somehow didn’t realize it at that moment.


Edit 5: my husband and I talked about this “friend” again after he came back home from his office. He told me another chilling fact that this friend had mentioned during the dinner which slipped my mind was that 
he (this “friend”) had seen/noticed her (the college girl) the day before when he was dining in the restaurant next-door.",user_166,1151,194

Layoff, breakup, and feeling like a ghost at my own job before it all went down. Three years in, I thought I had things figured out - until I didn't. Office politics, unspoken rules, and the little things that could turn your work life into a nightmare (or make it 10x easier). If you're new to the game or just trying to survive corporate nonsense, here’s what I wish I knew:

\- The office gossip who “knows everything” is the last person you should tell anything to.- Assume everything you say will be repeated. Walls are thin. So are loyalties.- HR is there to protect the company, not you. Keep that in mind.- Never send an email you wouldn’t want read out loud in court.- Discuss salaries with your coworkers, just not in an ego-driven way. Knowledge = power.- If you didn’t cook it or buy it, it’s not your lunch. I don’t care if it’s “just sitting there.”- Avoid being the chattiest person in the room—10-20% less talk is ideal.- No 8 AM or 4 PM meetings. Those should be illegal.- ""Anonymous"" surveys? Yeah, sure. Totally anonymous.- Don't send bad news after 2 PM on a Friday unless you want someone plotting revenge all weekend.

The offer was still super generous and would have him in the 97th percentile of earners in this country. The difference in entitlement level has me reeling.

**Acronyms in this story:**  
*FAANG*: prestigious tech companies known for great pay/hard interviews  
*URM*: under represented minorities, tech is very white and male.  
*ESPP*: a stock purchase program your company can offer you to get discounted stock  
*RSU*: restricted stock units sometimes given as employee bonuses basically, at companies like mine sometimes they are worth more than your salary  
*L4*: the job level my role seniority is with my work's system of labor categories, a ""Senior Engineer"" in my case, his too  
*TC*: Total compensation, equity + base pay + bonuses etc. Among high-earning tech people used to figure out how much we ""really"" make since equity is a lot of it

**Background:** I used to work at <small company> which got acquired by <prestigious company, near FAANG level> after I left. (Think something like Microsoft, well known, fairly valuable stock, although it isn't them its that kind of ballpark except WAY better pay). In the time since, my career has thrived - I made Lead in 3 years, went back to school and finished a degree in Software Engineering, my work has received a patent, I've mentored URM in tech, I'm a paid freelance writer for tech companies and been interviewed on tech podcasts and done endless work on side projects in my free time to advance my career. I have \~9 years experience as a SW Eng, \~12 in tech total.

Over the years I've kept in touch with <small company coworkers> and they've all loved the new company, during that time the stock has also blown up. I've had an eye on them over the years and once even applied for the software project I built for the small company, which <prestigious company> kept going (to my surprise)! I included the detail in my cover letter and everything but got rejected anyway which I found so funny.

In late 2023 after repeated complaints about a boss's gender bias, I was laid off (womp womp) but got a good severance because of how fishy the circumstances were + I got a lawyer. I used the money to attend an algorithm/interview prep program for software engineers and worked REALLY hard. In 2024, after EIGHT TOTAL interviews for this single job, I finally received an incredible offer from <prestigious company> and have been there ever since.

**The current issue**: My partner has wanted a new job ever since we started dating. I've referred him to several positions at my work. Recently one of them called him back and after four interviews, they told him they wanted to make him an offer. They had an internal candidate filling the role but were able to get additional headcount to hire him too.

I had given some general advice on what I thought he might get from the offer and he also had been consulting Blind, Glassdoor etc so had some expectations. He has a little more experience than me (12 years) but a non-engineering degree, and nowhere near as prolific in his side projects etc. His niche *maybe* pays a little less. My company is aware that they are very in-demand right now and seem to have adjusted packages across the board as a result.

His offer comes in, and his base is 4k less than mine, his equity is about half. He negotiates his base up to 5k higher than mine, but the equity doesn't move much. Although, he also gets beneficial conditions because of some stuff they changed with our ESPP program, first year vesting, and he also has a skewed vesting schedule (40% year one, mine is just 25%). The base is 50k higher than his current pay, TC 120k/year higher.

This man was...*mad*. He was mad he didn't get more equity. He'd couch the remarks with ""I know overall its a great opportunity but..."" then keep ranting. Initially I sympathized with him, I said maybe it was budget stuff because of the extra headcount, maybe it was because of how the stock value has gone up so much, I sympathize that his niche in tech is maybe slightly undervalued compared to mine. I was empathetic to a point.

But then I got really angry when he kept ranting on and on about it. When he said he wasn't going to go ""above and beyond"" anymore, realizing someone I put my name on the line for was coming into the opportunity of a lifetime with a chip on their shoulder was infuriating. So many URM would have killed for this opportunity. Heck, this company is so hard to get into they've rejected me for a job working on SOFTWARE I WROTE! It is not easy to get into. I had to do *twice as many interviews* as him to get it, I paid 10k for an interview prep program to get it. The job he got even got filled by the internal hire, so like what *phenomenal luck* they could even GET extra headcount to hire him! The ESPP changes, the preferential vesting, like there is SO. MUCH. GOOD. About this opportunity.

To see a white guy basically revile an offer that the URM I've mentored in tech would kill for just felt like such a slap in the face. I'm pretty direct so I told him how upset I was to hear this, that I wish I'd never even referred him and saved my effort and influence for one of those people who would actually appreciate it instead of turn their nose up at it. **This could have changed someone else's life**.

I'm still in shock over the level of entitlement.

A friend asked me if I'd feel the same as he did if the situation was reversed and I was in his position, and I could say 100% no. The whole time I was in my offer process I prepared myself for every worst outcome, low base, no equity, because I'm so used to having to fight for every little inch of progress. I actually even did have a parallel. My recruiter explained the stock price for my equity in a misleading way so tl:dr I originally thought I'd get something like 2x as much. Of course I had my small moment of ""oh that stinks"" but moved on almost immediately. I can't imagine behaving that way. It just reiterated to me how differently we exist in tech.

**\[Edits for the comments\]**

**This is now an ex bf, for those commenting on that front**

I'm very upset about this incident but don't want to be unfair here, so: more detail on bf. First, he has apologized - numerous times. He says he was just ""processing feelings"" about his surprise at the details of the offer. He is generally very progressive, and in the past has publicly bragged on me making 2x what he does. I would not consider him threatened by me in that way, at least not consciously. He often tells me he thinks I'm better at him at all this stuff, although it isn't really comparable (different specialties) so whatever. I've also earned more than him the whole time we have been dating basically and I don't feel like he's been toxic about it.

I do think it is plausible that his expectations were based on the past \~year of TC details posted on Blind etc, so I understand his surprise and was also surprised that the company is pulling back on stock so much, our offers are < year apart.

His idea of ""above and beyond"" also was like, working weekends etc. I told him that isn't our workplace culture and he shouldn't have been planning to do that anyway. Even so, his frustration and phrasing around it sounded like someone with an axe to grind when given an amazing chance and rubbed me so the wrong way.

It was not a ""lowball offer"" whatsoever. Well above industry average, and a 75% increase in his annual comp. Using an income calculator, his annual comp would put him at pay above 97% of people in this country. That's what I'm talking about when I say how jarring and out of touch this reaction was.

Some of y'all are asking in a rather uncharitable way why I didn't get an URM this job. I have mostly mentored remotely, people all over the country, so generally people not adjacent to HQ or remote offices. My company is VERY remote-friendly but they do mostly try to hire around the hubs so someone could come in occasionally (like monthly). In the case of this specific job, as non-diverse as tech is this niche within it is even LESS diverse. I don't know if I even know any URM with this specialty. I think my work is great and have been recommending everyone I know and encouraging URM I know to keep an eye on the jobs because it is a great place. Its a huge company, and I know a lot of people - I cannot realistically stay on top of every job we have and act as a part-time recruiter for every URM in tech I know",user_799,1095,291

After several years at my company, I had great performance reviews, got promoted every year, and had solid relationships with my coworkers and leadership. I took on big projects, delivered results, and people I worked with still give me great recommendations.

As the company grew, I had good relationships with multiple CEOs and execs (and still do)—but when the newest batch of investment company selected executives came in, the culture completely changed.

When I was up for a promotion, I had leadership backing, but I didn’t get it. Later, I found out that at a leadership dinner, the new execs straight-up said I couldn’t be taken seriously in a more visible senior role because I wasn’t “in shape.” Apparently, to them, that meant I was not be committed to anything and did not value myself enough to be in leadership.

Oh, and I later learned there were four unofficial but understood requirements for leadership according to the new execs:
Be tall
Be white
Be a former athlete
Be in shape

I checked three out of four, but that last one was enough to keep me out of the cool—I mean cruel—kids club.

A few months later, layoffs happened. My boss was asked to cut someone and picked an employee who had already failed multiple performance improvement plans—but leadership shut that down and made them fire me instead. The official reason? I didn’t have a senior title. And I didn’t have a senior title because… well, we know why.

Not long after I was let go, my boss—the only non-white exec in leadership—was also let go.

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about how much tech has started feeling more like a boys’ club fitness cult than an industry that actually values intelligence and skill. And when people like Mark Zuckerberg start talking about how we need more “masculine energy” in business and tech, it’s not hard to see how that mindset trickles down into companies deciding that leadership should only “look” a certain way.

Anyway, just wanted to share my experience and see if others have dealt with the same thing.",user_800,1072,59

I made sure to deliver everything you guys asked me to tell her, and she got a little uncomfortable, so I didn't push it too much, but told her that she must know that she IS making a huge impact and I have endless respect for her already. 

I lowkey expected her to be a hardass, and maybe she is on the inside, but on the outside she's just a nice person. 

We both had no make up on today (it was Friday), messy hair, sweatshirts, and it was cool to connect!

So the VP missed my interview on Friday of last week. You can check my previous post, but I waited around until 12:45 for him (my interview was at Noon). I finally got in touch with the director via email on Tuesday morning asking if he'd had a chance to talk to the VP and if they'd worked out a time and date for the reschedule. The director said he had a meeting with the VP that day, and he'd get back to me later with an update.

He didn't.

So on Wednesday I text the PM I used to work for to sort of...plant a seed. ""Well I haven't heard from Director or VP at all. Oh well! I appreciate you helping push them to interview me in the first place!"". I'm not sure what my former PM said to the director, but the director reached out to me this morning (Thursday) to inform me he hasn't spoken to the VP yet because the VP was traveling. I thanked him for the update and asked to be kept posted.

30 minutes later the director text me again to let me know the VP has been trying to text me for days but I wasn't responding. Evidently the VP was texting the company I used to work for, because their number was listed on my resume...in my work history section. My actual personal number was listed at the top, next to my name and email. So this VP was basically texting a landline. This entire time!

After a good laugh I shared with the director he passed off my actual real phone number to the VP, who text me a few minutes later. After another good laugh about it, he asked if I had time today to chat with him and I excitedly said Yes! We jumped on Teams this afternoon, and I absolutely nailed it. He was so impressed with my work history, my ability to speak about the technical aspects, my desire to work in a support role, and the fact that I'm local to the office I'd be working in was a big deal. He even agreed to my salary!

I should have an unofficial offer from the director by tomorrow. He's going to pass off my info to HR so they can draft an official offer letter to have sent over next week!

Woohoo! I'm finally going back to work!",user_802,1044,24

I work remotely since 2020 and basically only go to the office when I want for team building events or when I have doctor appointments in the city. Since I live a bit far and commute is long and doctors are usually during work hours in those days I prefer to work at the office, quickly leave to go to the doctor and then go back and finish my work.

Today was one of those days and I just remembered my old life before working in tech with 2h+ commute, waking up at 6.30am and getting home late in the afternoon, everyday. In my previous career my jobs were also unstable (short term contracts) and very badly paid. Not to mention extremely toxic work environments with crap management. And if you left you were jobless because there weren't that many opportunities. 

Today I looked at everyone around me in the train and in the streets and I remember there's people who still have that lifestyle and will always have because some can't study, others do, but still don't find good opportunities. 

I am so exhausted and it was just one day, imagine people who need to do this every single day of their lives until they retire.

Despite all complaints - because people always have something to complain about - I feel like I am really privileged for having landed a good tech job, with good pay (comparing with the national average), benefits and wlb.

I was thinking about my rollercoaster 2024 and realized something incredible happened that I wanted to share:

About a year ago we had 'the big resuffle'. Aka lot's of people shifted to new teams, new managers, new hires added, etc. Overall very jarring for many. 

I was shifted from a small specialized team (that surprise was majority women) to help oversee a larger team setting up new software. It was majority men (not a suprise).

The first few months were as many of you can relate to...frustrating. I had to hang up on a few times for personal attacks. Shut a few attacks down publicly. Let the team (and management) stumble and learn the hard way sometimes. It was a constant battle.

I also started to learn the team members personalities and what made each of them tick. What they loved doing vs tolerated, what they wished we could change vs why we couldn't. I started sticking up for them in a way other senior members before me apparently hadn't. I hand held the ones that wanted it and left alone the ones that preferred to be. I scheduled 1:1s to make sure I got everyones vote for the big decisions instead of allowing the loud ones to just steamroll over the quiet ones.

As months went on, the personal attacks became fewer. The team started collaborating more on projects and offering support to each other no questions asked. Instead of hearing 'My', 'I', Mine'  it became 'Ours', 'We', 'The Team'. 

I don't get as many private messages anymore asking me to speak on someones behalf in team meetings and I don't have to ping some of them to encourage them to speak up. Instead, to paraphrase one of them: 'I know if I bring up an idea you'll all work towards a solution with me. And if I question something or disagree, nobody will hold it against me. I might not agree with everything we do but I have a vote and I understand why we're doing it.' 

Having a team where members will apologize for cutting another off whether it be male or female is something else. Even if I offer up a solution during a 1:1 for one of them to present later, most will still say 'Bug recommended' or 'Bug and I were discussing'. They do it with each other too. 

If it sounds like a unicorn team I know. I feel that way too. They actively shut down toxicity from new members and other teams now. It's as if we all got caught in the toxicity of our company culture and now that we've broken away...we fight to protect it. 

It's not perfect, there a still bad days, and who knows how long it'll last, but it's a team I will always remember no matter where I end up. 

Thanks for reading and keep fighting the fight. ",user_199,879,43

A few months ago, I started a new role in tech sales for an established, name-brand company. It’s a great product, but a completely new industry for me — to keep it short, it’s been an incredibly difficult transition that’s somehow caused more stress than a year of unemployment. 

I’ve worked in male dominated sectors for years at this point, but this is my first time being the ONLY woman hired for a position. My colleagues are great guys, but they can’t fathom what it’s like to be a woman in tech. The hurdles we face are completely alien to them, the advice they give is borderline comical at this point. 

Trying to be proactive, I reached out to the sole woman in a leadership position at this organization hoping to find a mentor. What she told me absolutely broke my spirit. 

When we connected, she told me straight up that I’ll be successful if I talk less and dress better. She recommended that I start getting professional blow-outs, listed a few stores she shops at for clothes to improve my wardrobe and told me, in earnest, that men don’t appreciate opinionated women so I’m only doing myself a disservice by leading with my intellect. I sobbed when I got off the call. 

It’s taken me a long time to really process this conversation, I’m definitely still working through it because I’m posting here today.

The idea that my value is intrinsically tied to something I’ve done nothing to earn with diminishing returns, my outward appearance, is horrifying. The worst part of it all is that I genuinely believe this woman was trying to be kind. She was telling me “the truth” when we spoke and I absolutely hate it.

The complete burnout I’ve had since this chat is staggering. I was already feeling overwhelmed by the role, but this conversation was the last nail in the coffin for me.

I’m definitely fucking myself over by mentally checking out, but apparently my position doesn’t require much brainpower anyway.

Just seeking some solidarity and to remind all of us that we’re so much more than objects for the male gaze.

EDIT: 

Wow, this really blew up! Thank you all for the support and sage insights. I’m trying to go through comments to respond now. 

I’m cringing writing this, but it feels necessary to clarify — I’ve benefited from a lot of “pretty privilege” in my life. I’m absolutely not showing up to work like a slob, I take pride in my appearance and have “played the game” enough to get where I am today. 

I’ve also worked my ass off, constantly raising the bar and challenging myself intellectually. To ask someone for technical advice and be told that I’d do better without curly hair and a voice was absolutely devastating because … how I look is the least interesting thing about me. It’s the least interesting thing about EVERYONE, frankly. 

It just feels like we, as women, put in 250% effort only to be judged on the genetic lottery. It’s bullshit, it’s not fair and it needs to fucking stop. ",user_812,855,143

I was doing my Masters full-time and knew that the tech market was terrible but I didn’t realize it was THIS bad. I’ve been interviewing with this company since Oct and 7 rounds later, I got the notice that they are offering me the role!

Some tips and things I did along the way that I thought that really helped in this long process: 

* **Keep interview practicing**: I used TryExponent’s peer interviews a lot and also used Copilot/ChatGPT to restructure my answers in a different way. It really helped boost my confidence b/c since I was coming out of school full-time, I felt major imposter syndrome, even though I had 7 YOE and existing PM experience. I also ended up hiring a coach for 2 sessions on Leland to bounce ideas around on my interviewing style and this helped a lot! If anyone wants to know my coach’s name, please DM me and I’ll be happy to provide that. 
* **Referrals**: I’ll say that post-covid, referrals are helpful but not as useful as before. I would suggest to take the extra step and ask your referral person if they could also forward your resume to the hiring manager. I had 30 referrals during this time and only 3 made it to the interview stage. It’s vastly different than what I had experienced pre-2022 when every single referral would turn into an interview. 
* **Cold messaging on LinkedIn**: This helped me the most! I would do a search on LinkedIn for “ \[job title\] hiring” in the last 24 hrs or past 3 days. I would then message those hiring managers directly on LinkedIn via inmail. This got me the most interviews and I was able to send them my resume directly. My formula was to send a short intro/pitch prepared of my background and attached my resume.
* **Virtual tech hiring events**: Maybe it was just the timing but in the fall, I joined a few Women in Tech recruiting events and I was able to connect to a recruiter at my current offer this way. I literally googled “women in tech” events to see if any were happening. These can be a hit/miss but it’s a really short networking timeframe so even if you're not the best at networking, it's worth a shot. 

Through lots of imposter syndrome and discouragement after graduating, I managed to get through this with a lot of help along the way from friends and peers. I wanted to pay it forward and tell anyone that is still interviewing right now to keep going! You will get the role that you want. ✨

I am a white female who’s currently on a team of Indian men who all reside in India. I am a fairly outgoing, friendly person and I have a good sense of humor, but I definitely don’t take it too far, nor do I overshare. I’m just comfortable being myself and historically I’ve been well-liked in the workplace. 

But with these men, it’s like because I’m friendly and warm, they see me as some kind of idiot. I produce excellent work and yet they never seem to take me seriously. They are all dead cold and serious, and I don’t think I’ve ever seen them just…be human. 

Other teams in our department are not like this at all. They have good rapport and are able to laugh, joke, and bond (within reason). But those teams also aren’t primarily comprised of offshore Indian men. 

So, I have to ask: Is this a cultural thing? As a white woman, or a woman in general, do you have to have a cold persona in order for Indian men to respect you at all?

The responses were jaw-dropping. Judging by that post, most women in this sub don't welcome non-STEM women, even if they work in tech. The implication is that those of us who don't serve in engineering roles are not ""in tech"" and just want participation trophies.

I am not asking for a participation trophy. I joined this group not because I think I am technical, nor do I pretend to be. I joined it because I write about tech, which means I have a better understanding of tech than most people, but I still couldn't code my way out of a wet paper bag.

Regardless of my role, I face many of the same issues you more technically inclined women do, such as sexism and ageism. Hell, the marketing department at our SaaS company is 80 percent men, and with three exceptions, they are all under 40! The only department that isn't completely male-dominated is HR.

Beyond that, writing about tech is considered a niche, and it's difficult to break out of a niche unless you have a portfolio related to the industry you are applying to. So, like it or not, I'm sort of stuck with you.

Here's a reminder of what the group is about:

# A place for women in tech to connect, support each other, and find community.

# Our subreddit is a place for Women in Tech to connect and share ideas. Let's keep it a fun and supportive community!

# This subreddit was created as a safe and supportive space for women (cis and trans) and non-binary individuals who identify with the women’s community in tech.

If you want to commune solely with your STEM peers, I totally get it, but there are more specifically defined subreddits. Can we at least be kind and supportive on this sub? It's hard enough out there for binary and non-binary women, especially in the tech industry. Why should we make it harder?",user_821,748,254

I’ve observed that the most sexist and misogynistic men are those working in tech. Tech bros, gamers and all these men who's spend a lot of time on the Internet.

Even though they should be intelligent, they’re misogynistic. Professors, tech CEOs, regular tech employees—it’s widespread.  

I’ve never observed that level of misogyny among men in other fields. When I went to college to study computer science, even professors participated. They weren’t just awful to women, they were also racist.  

I believe even blue-collar workers have more culture. I’ve interacted with blue-collar workers, the ones with low-paying jobs like delivery men, plumbers, handymen, etc.—and I tell you, they were very polite to me. They respected women and were kind in their own way. For example, they might flirt with me or smile, but I’d associate it with old manners—like kindness, holding the door, and referring to me as a lady.  

These men,  sometimes seeing me as a target to flirt. I associated that with a certain respect, especially compared to tech bros.  

But tech bros don’t even pretend to be gentlemen. They’re rude and cruel. They seem to compete with each other to see who can be the most offensive.  

Here’s an example: I was the only woman among four men, and they told rape jokes in my presence. They laughed, knowing full well that such jokes are inappropriate and would make any woman uncomfortable. They’d also complain about their wives, talk openly about their sex lives, stereotype women, and say things like all women are dumb.

I feel like if blue-collar men saw the behavior of tech bros, they’d call them kids, men with small. My impression is that even these less educated blue-collar workers are better-mannered than tech bros.  

Blue-collar workers have tough physical jobs that seem to humble them, making them more polite. They possess real masculine energy. Sure, they can be sexist, but it’s the kind of sexism from a previous century—where they view women as weaker and treat them with a certain kindness, compliment, flirt at every opportunity, give flowers and hold door.

Meanwhile, tech bros act like they’re not fully grown. They don’t even look masculine. They’re not gentlemen, they’re rude and evil misogynists. They seem to think that being rude and cruel makes them Alpha and masculine. Pathetic.

They act like bullies who’ve never been knocked down by stronger men to humble them. They’re annoying kids the type who were bullied in school but landed in tech, surrounded by men just like them. Now, they feel strong by being mean and sexist to people who seem weaker.

Some people argue that DEI is bad because they believe individuals are hired based on gender rather than competence. On the other hand, in male-dominated fields, I’ve witnessed something similar men being hired and presumed knowledgeable simply because they are men. In reality, I’ve noticed that some of these men are less competent than they present themselves to be.  

First example, I read a book by a male author that had great reviews, but the writing was terrible. The book was tedious and difficult to read, with poorly explained concepts. Instead of simplifying ideas for the reader, the author seemed more interested in bragging about his knowledge. The book lacked empathy for the reader and felt more like a showcase of the author’s ego.

I just want to say this outloud somewhere. I want to work from home so I don't have to deal with men in particular in person.

I work tech sales (do I count as a WIT?). I am deep in bank and insurance transformation in non-technical way in projects. I have never had a female on my team, female manager or even barely one in my department in any company.

Why you ask?

I realised if I target companies and industries with virtually no women, I added over 20k each time to my base. The more women, the lower the salary I found, so it is entirely a choice thing. I would literally go through LinkedIn, check jobs, then check salaries, very rarely did I find a high paying job with multiple women in the company.

I'm not even talking them coming to me, this is me purely applying. I never had any issues, loved my job and had amazing career/salary.

I have spent over 12 years doing this. Since COVID, the level of sexual harassment and comments I get in-person and from the industry overall has gone two-fold. I'm talking events, clients, vendors..

I literally had a client I was working with for a year, perfect and professional. When they saw me in person, it was brutal, disheartening and disrespectful. 

The tech vendors are even worse, I had a professional dinner with clients. I had a leading cloud tech vendor manager say to my face, so would you consider sleeping with a client to close this deal?

Like. Truly. What has happened to the world. 

I don't think it's a 'me' thing as I never faced these issues before. I'm not dressed slutty, everything online is normal. But the minute a man (typically white, middle aged, married with children) interacts in-person it's..just disgusting. My home is way nicer place to be.

The whole world is talking about 'return to work'. I have children and I'm married, it's literally nothing to do with work life balance. I just don't want to deal with men overall in-person.

Does anyone else feel the same?

I worked for Germany's largest tech company for the past year and a half and was systematically bullied and sexually harassed by a male tech lead without end. When he was promoted to director, I quit the very next day. Prior to his promotion, I had complained to HR dozens of times and filed a whistle blow report. People management told me that several people had blown the whistle on this manager and that I was not new or the first. Despite this, nothing was done. In fact, they officially claimed that the things this man had done such as: questioning if women should get a bonus if they fall pregnant, express disapproval upon learning male colleague's wives were not doing their laundry, and pointing out the breasts of a female colleague and calling her a slut to mixed company, were ""not against  policy."" How nice must it be to be a man and fall upwards at everything? To destroy a team and face no consequence except reward? I can only dream.

On my last day I sent an email to all the women in my product organisation warning them of this man.  Compliance condemned me for it, but not him for harassing half a dozen women out of their roles. This pissed me off, so I went to the press and thankfully, [Bloomberg journalists took me seriously ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-20/sap-promoted-manager-after-repeated-accusations-of-harassment)and published an anonymous story about me and 5 other female colleagues experiences under this manager. 

  
After the article came out, many more individuals spoke about being harassed by this individual and reported his lacking skills and toxic behaviour on The Layoff. The company has still done nothing about this individual, and I am sure never will. But I wanted to share my experience because for the longest time, I had been lucky to work at companies with healthy, even split gender distributions and female tech leads. I had never experienced the misogyny within the tech space and saw it almost as a myth. Until I worked there, where it was all consuming and suffocating. While I was employed there, the CTO  had to step down for sexually assaulting a woman at a company party and they sent an email wishing him well after this. It is rape culture top to bottom. There's a deep rooted issue of sexism at this company and I genuinely pity any of my female colleagues still having to work for this vile misogynist who keeps being promoted and protected despite his lack of skill, empathy, or professionalism.

  
It sucked to lose my career that I had worked so hard for over this, but also I am glad I didn't leave quietly. For anyone else dealing with the same, be loud. He may not ever suffer true consequences, but he should at least feel uncomfortable.

I loved programming, got my first job in tech, and I gradually started to hate this environment. At first, I was excited that finally I would be contributing to a real project. But here’s what I found instead.

Toxic tech bros. Ugly, obnoxious men with bloated egos and little self-awareness or culture. They were educated men, with a lot of experience working in innovative technologies, but their culture and communication style was on the level of uneducated chavs the type of construction workers who whistle at women, tell sexist jokes, and drink alcohol.

I was treated as less intelligent; my opinions weren’t taken into account. I would speak, but none of them would acknowledge my opinions. They purposely ignored me because they were a group of tech bros who had consciously classified women as being in a servant role.

I have never witnessed such a concentration of such disgusting characters in my life. And these men had wives and kids. I stalked to see who their wives were, and they were uneducated women, not very pretty, but the main thing that connected their wives together was that they were less educated than their tech bro husbands. I presumed their wives were with them because they earn quite a lot of money and were somehow impressed by their lack of culture and boorish behavior. But no reasonable woman would accept these tech bros. They are not attractive, and their looks are the least of it the main issue is their disgusting, egocentric character.

Very low culture is the biggest part of this environment. The level of entitlement, and the fact that they think they’re smart just because they fixed some bug, is astonishing. Every single one of them thinks they’re special, like Elon Musk. They think they work in tech, so they’re smart because they optimized an algorithm by one second, and they think of themselves like they are geniuses. But in reality, they’re doing a bullshit job.

I used to love programming, but thanks to knowing that tech bros are so common in tech, I feel anxiety working and encountering them on the job. My biggest worry when I look for a new job is whether the team will be full of these disgusting tech bros. I’m at the point where if I joined a team composed of these entitled tech bros from day one, I would resign straight away because I don’t have the energy or mental health to deal with their toxicity. The worst part is that nobody reacts. HR isn’t reacting. I’m the problem for them. I reported tech bros a few times at my job, but I was the problem for them. It’s a fight of 1 vs. 10 tech bros. Nobody will side with you, no matter how accurate you are, because the reality for them is this entitlement, obnoxiousness, low culture, lack of awareness, lack of kindness, and empathy.",user_774,687,98

This weekend, I was attending my PhD classes and we were grouped in clusters of 4 students to help each other brainstorm possible solutions to our research problems.  Our group consisted 2 men and 2 women (including me.)  For the two guy's projects, I'd suggested tech-forward innovative solutions (like automation or robotics) that they admitted, they hadn't thought of, the other lady didn't have any expertise in the field so had no comment.  For the other lady's project, they guys provided some suggestions to her problem, to increase profits of a business, which involved consolidating real estate and I'd suggested offering other high value services onsite.  For my project, the clock was winding down on our time so I didn't get much feedback from everyone, but it did spark additional creativity from my part and I added 2 solution options of my own.

Well, once the group brain-storming session ended, the 2 guys turned to each other and said ""alright! We came up with a couple of good ideas at least!!""  High-fived eachother and fist bumped.  Me, waiting to join in on the celebration, was somewhat cringing but then shocked that these 2 men just celebrated just the 2 of them.  Prior to this, they were familiar but not friendly towards eachother.  I was just shocked by the display and didn't even do what I would normally do which would've been to celebrate with them anyways then turn to the lady and celebrated just as loudly.

Our next class we had was Linear Statistics, which I happen to love.  We all have to participate but guess who gets hate when she speaks up?  I had an older lady say right in class ""Well look at you!  Aren't you a Miss Smartypants?""  Would she say that to a guy?  I seriously am not showboating at all, just participating like everyone should yet I still get hate.  🙄  I refuse to dumb myself down for the fragile and insecure folks that I often encounter.  It's just disappointing since I joined this program to meet like-minded people and I feel so far from that.  Oh well, I enjoy the learning at least.  Thanks for reading my venting.

Is our only option as women to be a b*tch? I am not naturally that way, but after this experience I feel so vulnerable and, frankly, scared to just be myself. It’s like they’re just waiting to pounce on you, to show you “who’s boss”.",user_815,635,74

The assistant was the main one speaking and I don’t really work with her. So I think found it puzzling that she was speaking about me when she doesn’t really know me or work with me.

People only find out once I’ve started the job. I’m fortunate because I had a late start into adulthood. I didn’t graduate from college until I was in my mid-30s. So, according to LinkedIn, i’d be in my late 20s or early 30s today. By some miracle of the goddesses I have genetics that also make me appear in that age range. (I’m in my mid-40s)

In my past few interviews, my interviewer has made some comments about their children and my knee-jerk reaction is to empathize because I love talking about kids and want to find common ground, but I find myself fighting that instinct really hard to pass the illusion that I’m a young, unmarried woman in the hopes that it’ll increase my chances of being hired. This makes me feel sad and that I’m not really being my authentic self. But I’m so afraid of all the discriminations that are prevalent towards middle-aged, married women with kids in the corporate world.

What are your thoughts on this?

ETA: The reason I remove my wedding ring is because I was advised early on in my career that employers perceive married women as a liability because they either have or will have children, therefore not being able prioritize and dedicate more time towards work.

Long story short. Took the hiring manager forever to get back with me to schedule first interview with hiring manager (not his fault). Recruiter told me they were really interested after reviewing my resume over a month ago. Finally scheduled the interview this week. It went super well. I checked all the boxes , even had experience with a software that was brought up during the interview that wasn’t on the JD. They were looking for a strong background in business analysis. I’ve been a BA most of my career and progressed into PM roles. During the interview, he kept saying how impressed he was and how I spoke like a true BA/PM.

Here’s the odd part: at the end of the interview he went on a rant about how the company values diversity and that the team is 90% male. That it would be beneficial to “add some diversity “ (im a black woman with a very white male name btw) . ALL OF THAT JUST TO NOT EVEN MOVE ME TO THE NEXT ROUND! They saw my resume, they knew I was a PM. Im not understanding “too must project management talk” when you knew my experience before hand.

It's suggestion was  “Let your male co-founder talk about the tech choices — you can talk about Gen Z trends and color palettes.”

I’m building my startup for the past 6+ months.

I’ve made architecture decisions, written backend and frontend code, worked on recommandation, data layers, deployments , all of it.

Yes, my co-founder and I are building this together, but that suggestion was a reminder of something deeper:

Even on 2025 AI still reflect gender bias.

They learn from the internet and the internet still assumes the man is the “tech guy,” and the woman does the “soft stuff.”

This was a wild learning experience for me. I know that there’s nothing I could have done to save my job. I never got actual coaching on what I needed to change.

I was let go from Microsoft on January 22, 2025, and my soul is just.. crushed. I've been a front end engineer since before we were even classified as engineers, starting as a ""web designer"" when I was like 18 and working my way through a CS degree at a no-name school. I worked at various startups, and felt like I'd finally made it big when I started at Amazon around 2017/2018. I later moved on to Microsoft, still learning on the job and all that and still very much in love with TypeScript/React.

My sob story with Microsoft won't help anyone here, but basically, I had a bad review in 2023 when I developed an autoimmune as a result from my first Covid infection. I worked my ass off afterward, joining a new team, and getting glowing reviews. It just didn't matter. Now I'm out a job, with no severance, and all that hard work didn't even keep me employed. Hell, the night before the layoff, I had worked a 12 hour day just because I was so into the problem I was solving. I didn't have to, and nobody asked, it's just.. how I am sometimes.

I see so many posts about people that were laid off and have been unemployed for years now. The job I was in final rounds for informed me today that the role had closed. I guess.. is there even any hope for an experienced dev? I don't see myself as better than mediocre. I freeze up and feel paralyzed in interviews because if I don't find a job, I could very well die from the lack of healthcare - especially with medicaid being impacted by all the crap happening.

Anyway, thank you for reading. I've had a lot of people reading my resume, and reassuring me this wasn't my fault. Even my old boss went out on a limb and left me a glowing review on my linkedin. I haven't had to apply for jobs like this in over 10 years; all of this feels like a return to 2008/2012, and that left me pretty traumatized both mentally and financially. I was on my way to getting married, buying my first horse (not a typo, because who can afford a house these days anyway?), and being at least mostly debt-free. Now I'm just praying to find something before I burn through my savings and have to start over again.

  
edit: First of all, THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH! I've had so many people reach out with referrals and I'm updating and sending my resume/cover letters as fast as possible. For reference, I am mid-senior level with TypeScript and ReactJS.

I'm trying my best to respond to everyone; this community has been great and I'm so glad I found it! Going to keep at the grind, and keep the chin up. Might see about doing freelance if worst-comes-to-worst to avoid a gap on my resume as much as possible.",user_849,510,61

Three months ago I shared this post in the sub: https://www.reddit.com/r/womenintech/s/0nsWyyZZbk

My golden handcuffs are no more: yesterday my team manager blindsided me with a PIP. I noticed our meeting was at a different time and day, then 20 mins before our weekly 1:1 she says she wants to discuss my progress on performance goals she’d given me a few weeks ago and that an HRBP would be present bc it’s “common” for that to happen. Immediately I knew what was up.

My company gave me less than 24 hours to decide whether to accept the PIP or accept 12 weeks of severance and have my last day be today. Before the call ended, I pushed back and gave specific examples of me meeting performance goals, to which my manager just smiled and said “I appreciate your efforts but it’s not good enough.” I got a 7-page document with a PIP plan bulleting all of my shortcomings, 95% of which were never mentioned in our weekly meetings prior to me receiving it. 

She’d been silently building a case since October. In November, she started emailing feedback, something she’d never done before. She never outright told me I was on the road to a PIP or even being put on improvement goals. Even after a month of completing action items from Nov-Dec she still said “not enough” despite working to fix things.

Today I accepted a severance package and said fuck the PIP, fuck my manager, fuck the company. My access to files was cut two hours before they said it would be.

Yesterday I was crying and felt so shitty. I kept asking what I did wrong or what I could have done differently. For months I’d wake up out of my sleep thinking about work bc I wanted to prove myself so badly. Today I woke up after a sound rest, feeling relief for the first time in a year and I know in my heart it’s bc that wasn’t the place for me. 

I’m happy to have left on my own terms and with the support of colleagues who recognized my effort even if she didn’t. This is the first time I’ve ever quit a job without another lined up. I’m scared as hell of being long-term unemployed — I’ve never been out of work for longer than two months. But I know that I’ll bounce back 2x as better from this bullshit. Better to leave with dignity than to try and still be fired anyway with no money.

In one of the jobs I knew the odds were stacked against me. I ended up getting a rejection Wednesday morning saying I didn't show enough interest in the company and I didn't go into too much detail to what I did at my last jobs.  That was a fair critique and I am actually glad that someone gave me feedback after 16 months.

Today I was supposed to hear from the second job. This job I really wanted. I loved the company and I was literally dreaming about moving across the country for this job and starting a new life in the new city. 

This message was sent to me in response to my thank you email: ""it was great speaking with you! You'll be hearing more from us on Friday hopefully""

Today I made a special effort to monitor my phone and email. I waited all day jumping at every email or phone call hoping it was them with some good news that I had gotten the job. It never came. No news ever came by 4:45 PST I knew I wasn't going to hear anything today. 

I was crushed and got in my car to go get a snack and just sat in the parking lot and cried. I have been struggling for so long and I thought it was finally my turn to get the offer that gets me back on track, but no. No, it wasn't. 

I am not only heartbroken that I have to keep struggling and fighting for a job that I know damn well I can do but it also means I have to go back to my hell on earth job at the gas station. I thought I was finally going to get to quit that horrible job! NOPE! the universe wants to keep torturing me even more. I thought it was done torturing me with what happened last Monday! ( you can read about what happened in my post in r/retailhell).  I am still very traumatized by that and now I have to go back on Sunday. 

I know there is still a small chance I could still be given the offer but it wasn't enough to save me from having to back to my hell this Sunday. Also if they didn't contact me today with the offer, odds are they are probably giving the offer of a JUNIOR software dev to a mid or senior due to the messed up market or someone local. But that's just me making speculations because it has happened to me so many times. I don't blame them but it just hurts and stings. I worked so hard to get this far and I always get shot down because of something I can't control.

Honestly, I am tired of all the nos and I just want one yes. I shouldn't have to wait almost two years to get my yes. The human psyche is not designed to take this much rejection. I am just tired mentally and physically and I want to cry again.

Update: Just got the email. They rejected me and gave me the bullshit line about more aligned experience. I am currently crying my eyes out on the bathroom floor. I have had enough and I can not go back to that stupid gas station. This was exactly my point when I said when they asked what's wrong with the tech industry and I responded ""not giving the juniors a chance""",user_85,444,95

Though any advice would be helpful. 
For context, I have been trying to build my team remotely for the place I work. I have successfully inducted many talented individuals and have trained them never having met them in person. I am the only senior level manager who is remote. There have been many times where some of the talent I have trained have quit due to their interactions with the partners of this workplace. The interactions have been derogatory or of a judgy or bullying nature (or so I have been told from them) and I have tried my best to stand up for them and tell the partners to behave(in the nicest way I could). Anyway one of the things they do is, in meetings where I am not available, they double down on my team members and force them to do things that I have categorically told them not to do or things that even my team members know are the wrong course of action as we are a highly specialised team. The partners have zero experience in my field so they also don't make sense and don't really understand what we do as well. In one recent instance, a new member of my team was in a meeting on his own with some people including one of the partners. He has only been here a few days and is catching up with his role and the clients history. Despite knowing this they ganged up on him and tried to criticise him for not being informed and tried to get him to make decision that they know he's not experienced enough to make nor authorised to make without my approval. This has happened multiple times and it is exactly these types of interactions that lead to some really talented people quitting their jobs. This only happens in calls where I am not present. This time however I lost my cool and I messaged the partner after the interaction. The conversation is attached below. The guy then wrote me passages and then started calling me repeatedly. I didn't pick up because usually when he gets like this he gets really vile and yelly and begins denigrating me. So out of fear I let his phone calls ring, I also was out at the time(it was a day off) so I couldn't have this man yelling slurs at me  around people I know. I need someone to read this conversation and tell me if this is normal. Before my message I had just been talking to him about some positions we need to hire for.",user_856,432,165

Having a new and somewhat baffling experience - the gender stuff from younger staff.

I am well-versed in proving and defending my competence to superiors and peers - at this point male colleagues my age recognize and respect my contributions and that’s faded to non-issue. I’ve “fought and won” with them.

But recently we’ve hired some junior staff, and it’s like….for whatever reason it’s setting me off to experience gender stuff from juniors. It’s a new flavor of entitlement. They seem completely clueless of hierarchies. Some of it is entitled and some of it is mommy-ish (can you clean up the lunchroom, order my stationary?). 

Today a junior male staff asked if I was underneath a male with my same title. Our titles are in org charts and email signatures, it’s not that hard. The male with my same rank is a known alcoholic (sadly, separate issue) and as far as performance metrics, I push thru about 10x more volume than DUI hire. That dude’s on a PIP and to me, an obvious bullshitter. 

How are the young guys so clueless? 

I am finding it hard to “nurture” the ones who are intentionally/unintentionally insulting. How do I find the patience? Or is a blunt “are you fucking kidding me” going to be an effective approach? 

I wonder if I see it as “the culture should have figured it out by now” but the reality is “men leaving college/their parents will have to learn these lessons the hard way each and every time”.",user_858,428,84

I (34F) work as a contractor with federal employees and have done so for the last 4 years. As you may have heard in the news, the first thing that 🍊did was to force government employees into the office five days a week and announce massive layoffs of federal employees across the country.

As a contractor, I can be affected at any time because unlike federal employees, our contract can be cancelled at any time for convenience and just like that, we are at risk for being out of a job. 

To say that this has been psychological warfare on everybody is an understatement. No one knows what kind of cuts are coming next and these drastic cuts means that a lot of excellent technologists will no longer do the work that they felt compelled to do for the country. 

I have been waking up every morning for the past month crying, having a panic attack, or both. I have been working in civic tech since the start of my career almost nine years ago and I have found this field to be the most psychologically safe place that I have ever been in my life, especially as a woman of color. 

Sure, I complain about some of the men that I work with, but I have learned so much from everybody and I have enjoyed building things that benefit the American people in a positive way. I am afraid to go back to startups and private industry because I have been scarred deeply by mansplainers, unsupportive management, and backstabbing by co-workers. At this point, it is very likely that I will be losing my job next month and I am in pre-mourning because I am scared of everything that is about to happen, what direction my career will to, and my overall mental health. 

If you have made it this far, thank you so much for reading. Again, I want people to know that the people that they are randomly firing really loved their jobs and the mission that they serve and do not deserve the way that they have been treated. If there are any grammatical errors in this, I apologize, but I am doing this wrong on the fly sobbing and scared. 

**UPDATE**: Thank you everyone for the empathy shown during all of this. I thought about making this an update to my original post, but decided to do it here because it is going to be rather long. 

To give you all a peek behind the curtains: people who worked at 18F got an email of reduction in force last night right before midnight. One of the projects that a lot of people will be impacted by was the IRS free e-file which gave those who make under $80,000 an option to file their taxes for free. To say that I am sad and angry is an understatement. Please [learn about their work](https://18f.gsa.gov/) while their website is still up. People who worked there cared more than meeting minimum requirements and we will be worse off. 

The thing with 18F was that they were cost recoverable meaning that the agency runs by a cost-recovery model meaning that they are funded by already funded agencies for their services meaning that they do not cost taxpayers any additional dollars. This was done so thoughtlessly and this was very unnecessary to do in the name of “saving the government money”

They assured me I'm not in trouble so. Cool.

I updated my linkedin yesterday and had one interview. We'll see what comes next, and if I can get past this stupid drama that I never wanted to deal with.

Original Post:

Finally lodged a complaint with my boss on Friday about this dude who has been condescending af to me since the day I started…and who has also been kinda creepy. 

Note I’m a project manager and he’s an engineering manager (we both have inflated titles but these are the basic functions we fulfill).


Second note: BOTH he and I are POC. I’m going to state here now that I really really didn’t want trouble for either of us because under the current political climate, neither of us stands to benefit. Me probably even less but definitely him too. He’s also like, in his 50s? I’m maybe a few years younger than him but I happen to look much younger than my age even (this isn’t a flex - people treat me like I’m an idiot because they think I’m
a “young woman”).

ALSO: I’m on a contract. It’s a fairly lucrative contract but still just a contract. In this economy though - losing this job is very bad news.

The minor creepy stuff I was prepared to overlook because this kind of minor harassment happens so often with so many men, I can’t go around just being upset all the time or reporting every incident. I don’t have the energy.

Here’s the creepy stuff:

Dude openly checks me out and comments on my clothing and nails. He also sometimes touched my arm and shoulder and one time called me “baby”. For a while I speculated that maybe he was just enthusiastic about fashion (I’m giving him the benefit of a doubt). I even thought maybe he’s a gay man who is used to women treating him as a safe space. Literally I made up backstories for him in my head to justify why it wasn’t actually harassment….all while trying to avoid walking past his desk or interacting with him about anything non-work related.

The “gay” angle I mentally proposed had to get dropped when I found out he’s married to a woman. He could still be gay of course but you can be gay and a creep.

Here’s the not creepy but generally bs crap: 

Last Friday - day 5 of a go live gone absolutely wrong:

Dude basically told me to sit down and shut up because I was “distracting” the team by asking if we should get on a Working call to resolve an escalation. I was also asking if we ought to review test cases because we clearly missed something before we tried to go live. 

I told him it’s part of my job to try coordinating solutions and I am generally pressured by my managers to do so (in other words my managers expect me to do my job).

He went on to try to mansplain at me what agile scrum was (a model we don’t truly follow as is the case with most companies) and how to work with devs (my brother in Christ I have had a decade of experience in tech).

Anyway that was my breaking point and I submitted a summary of all of the above to my manager.

Note my manager is also a woman. She hadn’t seemed surprised, just resigned. Apparently she had provided the same feedback about him years ago.

Now HR wants to talk to me.

Given that he’s still around despite this pattern of behavior - I’m confident my feedback will go nowhere but I might lose my contract. My boss assures me I’m not in trouble and I need to not be afraid I’ll suffer repercussions but let’s be real here. We can’t make those sorts of promises. 

I fucking hate this kinda crap. I just wanted to do my job and go on home. I don’t like causing trouble. This all fucking sucks.

I'm a 31 F, working at an architectural design firm in Edmonton. I will keep this short because I am pretty upset and I know it will just turn into a big rant if I don't.  

I am newer there and lower level - junior designer slash BIM tech. But I have a degree and am frankly overqualified based on past experience and my skill set. We have a few Slack groups divided up by project, job and client. I'm on most of them because I am a newb, they have me bouncing all the time from thing to thing. So I get to see most of the messages across the company. 

It's almost all men. 30s to 50s. I am one of two women in the entire place other than cleaning staff. I almost didn't take the job because of that but I have a kid and student loans and can't not keep my pay at the level it was. 

My secondary work computer is a laptop and it was stolen a few weeks ago. It wasn't backed up so I lost a lot ofwork and had to redo it. It took a lot of extra time. This caused delays and a headache with two big clients and my project leads and boss have treated me like absolute shit ever since. 

After that the running joke on Slack about *“diversity hires”* has been getting out of control.Nobody has said they mean women specifically but all the details about what happened with me have been mentioned very clearly. The have gone as far as saying it's so sad how the company is *“lowering the bar"",* that this is why the economy is so bad. 

The supervisors are on these threads too. They steer clear of that stuff but they don't stop the constant jabs either. Based on their treatment around the office I feel like they actually hate me. I can't go to them. The owner is the biggest douchebeg of them all. 

We are all contractors I think so there is no HR. It's ""in the works"" they tell me. 

The other woman I work with has become an ally and a friend through this and we want to get out of there but yeah we can't afford it. We want to resist. But there is nothing to do about it. Sick to my stomach of the backward slide things are taking, women are becoming second class citizens again.

Want to burn the place down. Nowhere else is hiring where I am.

Sorry if there are men on this thread I know you are not all the same but sorry sometimes it feels like you are.

I am so frustrated I want to scream.

I landed on an amazing team. About the same time, a Staff+ Scientist woman with 60+ years old moved there and we clicked and got work done in 4 months that hadn’t been done in the whole year. We ran into the misfortune of being moved under a new manager a month ago and man has it been a fight. The team is 75% women, most of us are remote. Already caught the guy red handed praising the guys and bullshitting the girls in literally the first week. Me and the staff+ have had to go out of our way so he doesn’t get away with it, one of the girls quit and another one changed her mind after we publicly defended in a meeting with a wide audience. 

I genuinely do not comprehend how they can hate women, like, bro, you came out of one. I know some of these fights I picked will cost me in the future but I don’t care. Totally worth it. My wife also works in tech (same company as me, that’s how we met) and some of this stuff breaks my heart truly.

Now, my question: all my 15 YOE are in the same company. I was 18 when I started here and this has literally been my only job. Is it like this everywhere? What are other things I can do aside calling out bullshit when I see it to help my team? Literally these girls are not only smarter than me and are outperforming most of the organization lol I don’t wanna lose any of them.",user_866,382,91

Folks, these companies DIDN’T EXIST when my career began.  I somehow remained employed regardless.  These companies create some sort of mystique and pay highly so they can attract more people and treat them like crap.  They also aren’t the bastions of cutting edge technology that they claim. They act like they’ve invented “leet code” - I had knowledge of all those concepts before that through experience and data structures and algorithms classes.  At the end of the day, they’re running a website and trying to reinvent things like space flight that other companies have been doing for decades.   Automotive, medical, aerospace, and large scale manufacturing all have huge companies with intriguing problem spaces.  Some of those companies have much better work life balance, job security, and less misogyny.  No, you won’t get paid the money you can make at a FAANG (except maybe in finance, but it is also renowned for bad work environments), but you can get paid well and have a life and practice some self care, which is very valuable to me.  Maybe it isn’t to you, and that’s fine, but this craziness where we act like “it’s a horrible work environment or nothing!” Is simply demoralizing and untrue.   I’ve switched jobs to find a great fit for me, and that includes a job where I experience very little misogyny or homophobia.  I like my boss.  I like my coworkers.  If I fall ill, I’m not worried that I’ll lose my job. 

Don’t give up on software if, like me, you love coding but don’t want to work for a FAANG.  There’s more to life than optimizing an algorithm for buying Chinese third party tchotchkes.  You can still do really cool stuff without helping a misogynist billionaire succeed, and that’s all you’re truly doing at those companies.

I am a 43 year old data engineer with a BS in CS. I live alone. 

I am in the middle of my company who acquired my old company doing a huge RTO push that will end my 15 years of remote work. I just got my first review/raise with them and it was the worst of my career and no other reason than I am remote. My manager told me new company reduced all of their ratings for remotes and he was not allowed to give any input on compensation. 

But I can’t find another job because the market is terrible, right?

Zuck and his tech bros hate women and want us to stay at home, right?  

And even if I survive those two things, AI is going to replace me right? 

I am literally terrified all the time, I doomscroll constantly, I have massive PTSD from my last bout of unemployment which lasted 8 months and led to a legitimate suicide attempted. The reason that pushed me over the edge is I was afraid I would never be able to find work again and I had been through too much to continue.

I have a therapist and I am trying to work on this but I feel like I am basically in mortal terror of reliving that 8 months that I was unemployed. I had zero support from family, I lost my relationship, my home, I was couch surfing, terrible things happened to me because of this. People took advantage of me, targeted me, robbed me, and abused me.

And now all I see on here, on all social media is all these asshole CEOs talking about how they hate women, hate remote work, hate paying anyone they could replace with AI, and don’t want to let me work or survive. Guys the stress is killing me since RTO started 6-8 months ago.  I am so sick I have been having terrible GI issues and now am getting endless invasive tests to figure out what is wrong but I have a feeling it’s going to just be due to stress since they haven’t found anything so far.

And what do I even do? Do I just bail on this entire career? Do I go back to school? Do I go deeper in?  Originally, I wanted to be a psych major and do research. I like data. Do I get a degree in DS. Do I sell my home and downsize and try to hoard cash. I feel absolutely terrified and lost and confused and I’m afraid it’s going to break me.

I’m one of only two women in a company of 10. The other woman’s been here 10+ years and has fully adapted the bro mindset—zero allyship 👎I’ve been here five. 

For the last two years, I’ve watched how every time I bring up actual issues—lack of team structure, zero communication, no leadership—I get punished. Tasks taken away, sidelined, ignored. Meanwhile, they celebrate the squirmiest guy in the room, even if he’s barely out of school and constantly screws up projects I have to fix. He has zero understanding of quality, strategy and planning. I have to do it all and teach him while he takes the credit at the end. And he’s now doing my job and thinking he’s good at it. He has no experience. 

When I point this out, I’m “too emotional.” Classic.

I’m not some fresh intern. I have a BA in Graphic Design & Visual Communication, multiple certifications (Yale, UC Davis), and 16 years in marketing, design, digital content, and psychology. But my expertise means nothing here. I’m also the lowest paid employee in the company. When I brought it up last year, they literally said, “How did you know?” Then gave me a 1500kr (€200) raise… spread over 3 months. Yay. The new salary I am on is the salary of what a candidate would start up at, at a new company with little experience. 

The place is chaos. Nobody communicates, there’s no leadership, and “teamwork” is a joke. When I tried collaborating, no one cared. When I stopped and mirrored their behavior, suddenly I’m the problem.

Company of less than 20. But we have 2 CEOs, 1 CTO, and 1 CFO. Ego parade.
One CEO is a little narcissistic & misogynistic who micromanages and does not listen to his employees, the other is a people-pleasing labrador who calls us a “family”, takes everyone’s emotions at heart and resists any change. I like him best but his light and his power has diminished in the last year and he was sort of the only one that kept it together somehow but not anymore. 

I’ve had two breakdowns in this place. I’ve been job-hunting for 1.5 years and it’s brutal in my area of expertise. I’ve contacted my Union to tell them about it and they just said talk to your boss which I did several times. I even have recordings, since it’s a one party consent state so I can protect myself. So what do I do?

Do I just go full grey rock and do the bare minimum until I finally land something new? Or is there a better way to survive this without completely losing my mind?",user_873,346,85

I was shocked. Speaking to an audience of hundreds of women and she chose to use the example of how to lose weight using AI. As a gen Z, I felt like I had traveled back in time.

And horrible to promote taking health advice over…idk…talking to a doctor or dietician if you’re concerned about your weight.

I chose CS when I was a teenager. I didn’t think that when I started working, there would be 50 men and only 5 women in my workplace.

Being in that environment makes me uncomfortable. They often stare at you constantly.

I’ve experienced this from college to the workplace progressively. Sexist jokes told by professors and male students joking about women not being good at this field.

Then at work, they underestimate you. To them, you’re dumb, and you have to prove otherwise. They watch you, even if you don’t notice it. They believe that even if you got the job, you’re still stupid, so they search for your mistakes and blow them out of proportion.

A mistake made by a man is seen as a small thing. A mistake made by a woman is ten times serious.

The opposite applies to achievements. A woman’s accomplishment is dismissed anyone could do that. A man’s accomplishment is seen as something difficult he did a great job.

I won’t go into more detail. Everyone pretty much knows how they behave.

My question is: how do you stand up for yourself?

- Shouting over them, not letting yourself be interrupted.
- Interrupting them if they interrupt you.
- Being louder than them.
- Pointing out their mistakes with confidence.
- Defending your point of view.
- Having allies.

But these strategies often don’t work. They see you as rude. You don’t know your place. A woman who tries to be better than them or points out their mistakes is a disgrace to them because they always assume women are dumber.

They allow women to work, but only on the most boring, unimportant tasks. They take the ambitious, influential work for themselves. Women aren’t allowed in those roles because they see them as a threat.

If you’re a single woman, they’ll never truly be allies with you. They stick together in their bro circles. They think they’re being friendly just by allowing you to work with them so you should be grateful. You’re treated like a cleaning lady, never someone more important than them.

Even if you’re right and they’re clearly wrong, they won’t let a woman correct them. They’d rather listen to the most influential bro in the room.

I’ve witnessed this: they discuss an idea, and everyone is uncertain about it. I know the solution, so I say it. Then a tech bro proposes an alternative (I know mine is better and will work). The rest of the tech bros, who are unsure, vote for his idea without thinking. Later, the same tech bro ""discovers"" the solution I originally proposed and acts like he invented it. He doesn’t even remember that I said it first. He says he has been inventing that solution for days.

Other women behave like  pick me girls. They back up the most influential tech bro. They may seem nice, but in the end, they will shove a knife in your back if they can benefit themselves

Any ideas on how to earn respect and climb to the top?

My true personality is to be blunt, point out their mistakes, and not be overly pleasant. But every time I did that, they excluded me and turned against me.

On the other hand, if you don’t stand up foryourself, you end up in the role of a cleaning lady doing the least influential and least important work while they grow and climb the ladder.

I’m not here to invalidate any other experiences, but I’d like to provide a ray of hope.

Straight out of grad school, I started as a junior software engineer at a startup in San Francisco. This was, in hindsight, kind of a blow — I had a master’s in robotics, and other people (men) with less education got hired as software engineers, without junior in their titles.

With that said, from day one, I was always listened to. I had a seat at the table. I worked my ass off, but I won’t discount that I was lucky to be treated as an equal.

Within a year and a half, I become software lead, and in another year and a half, I was promoted to CTO. 

The industry is robotics with heavy machinery applications, and I have a team of absolute all-stars who make sure that people know who I am. Our head equipment operator takes every new operator hire aside and makes sure they listen to me. At industry expos or similar, the rest of the leadership team calls out sexism before I do — “can you believe that guy called you a Female CTO?”

There are plenty of problems for women in the industry, but there are places where it’s good, and it’s a delight to be here.

Some team lead jobs came up last year that I went for and got that job. The job was never recognised as a level so I have been double jobbing doing development and leading the team. I also never got a pay bump. 

There were 4 team leads for 4 product pillars. We all got an email last week about 3 manager roles for those 4 pillars. I asked my manager and he was turning me against going for it saying there are only 3 roles so don’t be annoyed if I don’t get it.

I applied anyway and had to do 2 rounds which went extremely well, along with a presentation. 
My manager setup a call for 15 minutes yesterday saying I wasn’t selected with no reason. He didn’t even mention it was a tough decision, so seems like the candidates were already selected and he completely wasted my time.

I asked for feedback and he gaslit me saying I should be doing more, getting more involved with projects which is complete BS, and I called him out for that. I’m leading more projects than any other team lead. He also said if I work harder there will be more positions.. so do more work for less pay and do exactly what the managers are doing.

What isn’t sitting right is 3 men got the job and I was the only female rejected. I have more skills than a lot of them. It’s also super embarrassing now that they will be announcing these new roles to the company and I’m the only team lead left that hasn’t been promoted. 

Am I to just accept this and continue doing what I’m doing with no progression? I feel like I’ve been completely taken advantage of and manipulated into doing more work now so I can get this manager role in the future. 

Any advice appreciated. I feel like I need to setup another call and show him how the optics do not look good, looks like gender bias. 
At this point, I’m open to moving to another company, I really enjoy working with the people but can’t believe how  I’ve been treated.

I would’ve been a lot more aggressive and fought back against the boundary violations. I would’ve trusted my gut about the passive-aggressive disrespect.

I’ve been reading so much sexist BULLSHIT on here. I’m so tired of people underestimating us. I’m tired of people stealing our thunder. I’m so tired of it all. But more than that, I’m FUCKING FURIOUS. This world runs on the backs of women - on our bodies, on our unpaid labor, on our mental effort. And I’m so fucking tired and angry that once again, we have this administration and its oligarchy coming for us. So you know what I wanna do? I wanna fight. I wanna pool together our resources so that we’re doing something. 

I wanna take back control.

A while ago, I had a thought about having an organization where women make (tech) products for women.

Because women’s wallets have power. Women’s needs have value.

And of course, with all the anti-discriminatory laws, it wouldn’t have been possible to hire only women. Well, looks like this administration just gave us the power to do just that. 

I haven’t figured out just how to go about any of this. Idk how to go about funding this. Idk how this looks like as a business plan. Idk any of that.

All I know is that so many of us are on here keep getting taken advantage of in this extremely unfair, sexist world that undermines and underestimates us at every turn. 

So let’s put our heads together and fight back. 

Thoughts? 

Anyone with me?

It goes without saying this is a huge generalization. I've met wonderful people in leadership who were genuine and fighting the good fight. But after a stint at a very large company, I'm beginning to think they are the exception. It's the sort of thing you can laugh at when it's on the TV screen. When you see it in person, you have two viable options:

1. Leave for greener pastures
2. Stay and hope you develop enough of a sense of detachment such that you don't sprout a brain tumor in 10 to 20 years time

I witnessed what could have been nice people twist themselves up into paranoid bullies with huge victim complexes. I've met creepy brown-nosers masquerading as friends (and yes, quite a few of them were self-proclaimed ""male feminists""). I met one woman in particular who, in private, could not have cared less about the younger women who reported to her, and yet publicly branded herself as an advocate for women in tech. (Don't meet your heroes!)

All the money in the world could not justify their outlook on life and I thank my lucky stars I did not slide from a comfy life and cushy education right into a corporate job. The very people who see themselves as intellectuals, as ""born-leaders"", are unknowingly walking around with blinders seared to their heads. They could not be more insular and tasteless if they tried!

I think part of the problem is people assume I'm easier to manipulate than I am. They see female with blonde hair and they think ""Oh yeah, here's someone who I can control the narrative with"". I'm now more wary of so-called advocates for women than I am of that edge-y guy at after work drinks who doesn't know any better. At least the latter doesn't try to sell themselves to you on the false pretense that they're a good person.",user_888,297,38

However, I worked hard and started to make a lot of progress. 

Eventually, I started getting recognized by leadership and others, and received some positive call-outs in department-wide meetings. I also got put in meetings where I had a lot of exposure to leadership. 

But as soon as this happened, it’s like my entire team, which happens to consist of all men, turned against me. No matter how well I did, they acted like I was insignificant and like I shouldn’t be taken seriously. They would criticize my work and talk over me. The Product Owner on my team started to take tasks out from underneath me, things that I was perfectly capable of handling. I would sit on calls where he would present and speak to my work as if it were his. None of this was discussed with me prior. 

It felt like they were trying to erase me completely, and it was blatant. It was aggressive. 

It became so uncomfortable and I felt so dominated that I’ve made the decision to leave. 

Clearly it seems like a case of jealousy, but I have never experienced this level of it and I can’t imagine that grown men would actually go this far. Is this really what men do when they feel threatened?

Something that keeps happening is I tell them something, they disagree, and a week later one of them says we need to do the thing I said a week ago instead. Not as an acknowledgment to me, but like they just realized. 

Also. They NEVER call in sick. They’re so weird about sick leave and PTO. My company is super non chalant about time off. But it’s like a personal failure to them to call in sick. They looove talking about working through sicknesses. Whyyyy?? We’re not even that busy right now. 

I’ve neeever felt like this at work and now I leave every day feeling terrible about myself. This wasn’t an issue with any Canadian man I’ve worked with or under, which is a ton. Even meetings that are predominantly Americans feel so much more tense and competitive than majority Canadian meetings. I also wouldn’t say the Americans are putting out more or better work than the Canadian teams, but they just act like they’re gods. It’s so weird to me and I hate it.

I'm a woman in my early 30s working in tech, and something happened recently that's been bothering me. I was at a company sponsored event where there was drinking involved, and the CEO pulled me aside and made a comment about me being ""hot."" It caught me really off guard—especially because all night he had been looking at me in a way that felt... off.

To make it more frustrating, several senior male coworkers also spent more time talking to me about my appearance than anything work-related. I felt like no one was seeing me for the work I do—just how I looked in a dress.

People often remark that being a tall woman means I automatically command respect, but in situations like this, I feel reduced to a stereotype or an object rather than a peer or professional. I thought that being in a senior position would also make a difference, but it seems like in some ways, things are as they always have been

I didn’t know how to respond in the moment. I got flustered and laughed it off, but now I’m left wondering if I should’ve said something—or if I *should* say something now.

I have a M.Sc., worked on the first YouTube codec backend, a satellite, high performance computing for Intel, WiFi, audio firmware, , and lastly mass storage.  I’m familiar with C/C++, Python, Go, etc.  Languages are just tools to me.  I’ve done front end down through backend API, to driver, firmware, and even minor DSP.

And I hate this industry.

Unfortunately, it’s a bit more complex than simple ‘hate’.  I sincerely don’t care beyond a means of income and I’ve fully accepted that I’ve hit a ceiling I’ll never surpass.  I am usually someone who gets above expectations reviews and I’ve typically only lost work through choice of my own or VCs closing shop.

This time around, I found myself just staring at the screen utterly unmotivated.  I recently lost my job of 3.5 years.

But here’s the rub.  I’m sick of the very nature of this industry.  There is never any collaboration, never any kindness.  Just type A competition from men who need me to fall into one of two categories; bitch or innocent doe.

I’ve spent years developing the personality required to filter ideas through men, never be “too assertive”, never share code or ideas until I was prepared to defend them to the death. No “Hey I was thinking about doing X, here’s a draft.  Whatcha think?’.

Danger mode all the time.  That’s why I got good reviews.  Terror and 70-80 hour work weeks.

Is someone falling behind?  Is someone having a bad week?  They’re “trash’.  The company needs “only a players”.  I’ve survived so much turnover and much of the time it was never deserved.

Does a manager ask “How can I help this person be successful?” or “are we setting clear expectations?”.  Or heaven forbid, “how can we all help as a team and help this person grow?’.  Never happened in what I’ve seen in 20 years.  People just smell blood and isolate anyone who sticks out.

The other irony?  I’m a trans woman.  I’ve lived as a woman my entire adult life, and have had the good fortune of flying under the radar (Although I really don’t care now).  My best friend sometimes says “if I were you I’d just never tell anyone”.  But that’s just more invisible chains and shame.  But it’s kind of funny to me that I had made a career out of invisibility for fear of getting clocked.

My life has absolutely helped put the life of a woman into tech into sharper relief, because I know what most of this industry horseshit is about.  There is no equality, no seeking empathy or cooperation, because that’s just not how most tech bros work.  Even software is some proxy dick measuring contest.  I feel for women who must constantly second guess themselves or wonder if “it’s them”.

I finally got some medically necessary surgery last year.  It was the direct reason I was let go.  

Once, many years ago, I was seriously sexually assaulted by a more senior engineer outside of work.  I reported it and was laid off within a month.  Despite yearly reviews not being due for 8 more months and having no prior negative feedback.

There is no way for me to keep making my salary doing anything else.  I’m not worried about finding work because there is -always- work somewhere.  I know it’s rough now for junior folks, but there is always something.

But I don’t know how to break this mindset?  How do I go back into this world which is so distasteful to my personality?

Has anyone hit this wall before?

I used to dream of making tech that would help heal this world.  I’d be happy just working a normal job in exchange for money like everyone else in the world does.  But this mindset, this feeling, is close to making me want to quit tech for good.

- spreads tech misinformation such as AI can do everything and replace everyone
- shares all of the shiny benefits working in tech

None of them talks about
- detailed dive-in to any technology they promote
- the fact that it takes years to become a good and solid engineers
- there are tons and tons of discriminations against women in tech

And the fact that companies like Code Academy only collaborates with all of these beautiful women who dress in skirts and cropped tops is so disheartening. Don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing wrong to dress whatever you want. I dress like that, too.

I am transitioning my career to executive roles and I want to share a revelation that I've had through coaching and networking with this experience: **Get more comfortable bragging about what you've done.** 

For the last 15 years, I've focused on doing--I was just chasing big data and interesting problems to delight customers. I don't have a CS degree but I've worked hard/smart and been successful. Not having a CS degree always made me feel inferior so I would work harder, bigger, innovate more. I felt alone in my space but when you're alone, you don't know if it's because you're behind everyone or ...if it's because you're out in front. I always just assumed I was behind everyone since I didn't see my early career peers in the same spaces I am in now.   
  
This process has made me realize that in my case, I was alone because I was out in front of the technical innovation. But...I never talked about it until NOW as I'm trying to 'sell' myself to company leaders to hire me to run their Product/Eng orgs. 

**So let's give it a try. Let's practice bragging. Tell me some dope ass shit you've done.** 

I joined a startup when it was valued at $100M and built out a full suite of analytics products into the product and increased the valuation to $550M when we got acquired--in less than 2yrs. These products also had the fastest data performance on the market and the largest implementation of its kind in the world--oh yeah with an 88% (!!) customer penetration MoM. I won industry awards for technical innovation all while promoting my team members and keeping attrition low while we cranked out this incredible product set. I build sexy products that are fast as fuck, boyeeee. ",user_899,262,22

Most of the top positions and highly paid positions are going to men, and this is becoming more blatant with the open condemnation of DEI. There is no win. Even if you get hired, most of us have extensive experience with being the only woman or woman+POC on the team, and it's not going to be pretty as most of the problems will be blamed on us. We will be penalized for family leave, etc. 

On a side note, in my last 15 years in the industry, the only time I had female interviewers on my panel was twice in these 15 years. Biotech was markedly better but they are going through a terrible recession worse than tech. 

I'm wondering, what are some of your plan Bs? I've definitely thought of moving closer to the mountains, and trying to find a different life. However, in order to execute I need a better plan and I'm not able to come up with that. I'm leaning towards something like a small private tech company that targets a niche market and makes enough for my comfortable little life. But it's such a pipe dream. I am putting it out here, so that I can learn more from all you smart ladies, on how you plan to navigate the next decade and after. 

A lot of men in my experience just don't get what the reality is on our end and chalk the whole thing out to their superior competence which is emotionally discouraging, so I just don't discuss this anymore with any one who identifies as male in this industry.

This story started Friday and is WILD. 

I live in a very tech-centric city. I've been here and in the field almost 10 years. I'm very plugged into the meetup groups and slacks and discords, and work at one of the better employers in the area. (This background becomes important later). 

I recently had extra tickets for some local events, and decided it might be fun to meet some new people so I threw them up ""first come first serve"" on some local hobby/interest slacks and discords in my area. Both got quickly snapped up, cool. One of them was for a disco costume party at a local venue and a guy from one of the hobby groups asked for that one first. 

His initial message was complimentary in a way that put my guard up, so I immediately clarified that he was welcome to use the ticket but I had some <hobby> friends at the event who I'd be spending the night with. He says, ""Great! I'm new to the area and would love to meet some new people"". He keeps messaging me frequently throughout the day and I mostly ignore it because I'm working, and it is clearly weird the amount of messages he's sending. At various points he gives me his phone number, and then mentions his employer. People on this hobby discord use handles and mostly not face-picture profile pics, it is relatively anonymous, and I told him **""You shouldn't give out so much personal info, I have hacking chops and there are some weird people in online spaces like <group>""**. (This becomes important later too, lol). Immediately he comes back with a NEW bevy of messages saying how cool blahblahblah, he is just finishing a Cybersecurity program and trying to pivot into tech from Sales/Marketing. 

Shortly after, he makes a flirty comment and I immediately shut it down ""Don't flirt with me, that is not how this +1 situation is going to go"". He assures me he wasn't flirting, he is just big on compliments, if I say something funny he'll tell me I'm funny, if I look nice he's going to tell me I look nice, because he's just a nice guy. (Thats basically exact words). Immediately I'm like, this clown. I just drew an extremely clear boundary and he IMMEDIATELY comes back trying to tell me he is going to cross it because he's a NICE GUY!? Like gtfo. 

Long story short, event rolls around, I'm there with a guy friend talking, I see this guy come in. He's a mess and I already planned to report him to the mods of the <hobby discord> but I had expected he'd try to talk to me even though I stopped answering him. Instead he makes a loop and I assume he's getting a drink. He then sends ANOTHER message < 10 minute later saying he left early because I didn't seem ""keen to hang"". So, even though he ""just wanted to make friends"" in the area he had no interest in meeting new people like the <hobby friend> I was talking to. Obviously full of crap and thought he could turn it into a romantic connection. 

Here's where it gets really, REALLY funny. 

The next day I go back and screenshot all his messages to send the mod of <hobby group>. He hasn't deleted anything which surprises me because it is fairly damning. Send over the screenshots to the mods for them to discuss how to handle it.

After a couple hours waiting to hear back I realize, hmmm I DO have his phone number and employer after all. On employer + first name (which is all I knew) I didn't get any hits. For phone number, i did the paypal lookup trick though and boom, there he is. From full name I triangulate employer.

I'm on some vouched/verified dating forums in my area and on a hunch, go look at those. Sure enough, I find a SLEW of things about this guy who is clearly cheating on his wife (and apparently not disclosing STIs to future partners). I then have enough to find his LinkedIn profile, with corresponding information that lines up with what he told me about his Cybersecurity program, and a BS that lines up with the state he said he moved here from. It is definitely him.

EXCEPT! The employer he told me is NOWHERE in his job history. His current job title isn't even Sales/Marketing either. I asked nothing about his employer, and he told me this random lie to what end? At this point I'm like, ok this guy is a parade of red flags, and send over all the new stuff to the mods and they promptly ban him from <hobby group>.

Here's the funniest part of this. I already got him blacklisted from the hobby community within 24 hours of him starting to bother me. (A bunch of other women on the discord popped up saying he'd messaged them weird things too). This man also clearly had no idea that I am a veteran of the field he's trying to get into. I work in the security group in arguably the BEST employer in the area, and I have worked at/maintain connections with some of the other better employers in the area too. I go to the meetup groups, the conferences, a huge number of my friends in this area are all in tech.

Brosef had NO IDEA that he was showing his a#$ to a woman well-established in his field who might ever interfere with his tech pivot. This is one situation where the bigoted assumption that tech is a mans world worked out in the absolute funniest way possible. He assumed I wasn't smart enough to see through his boundary pushing, and he certainly NEVER imagined I'd get him booted out of the hobby group and also be in a position to hinder his attempted pivot into a first tech job. Normally it is so insulting to be underestimated or assumed to be nontechnical but in this situation I am absolutely losing it laughing over the unforced error and how funny the results are going to be. I also added my voice to the list on the vouched dating posts about how aggressive and concerning this guys behavior was, so possibly have made his dating life harder too. It truly blows my mind how many unforced errors were in this story. By being a crappy person for no good reason he has potentially made his dating life, professional life, and attempt to make friendships in this area so much harder than they needed to be. Not to mention that I've told every tech friend I know about this story and we have laaaaaaughed about the opsec of this ""cybersecurity"" wannabe like, RIP. Anyway, this story was so bizarre and funny I just had to share, hope anyone reading gets a laugh out of it. ",user_799,253,30

To begin with, I’ve never liked tech. Perhaps the last time I genuinely liked coding was 4+ years ago and this wasn’t the career I was hoping to pursue for all of my life.

This is where I’m at - I’ve got a pretty decently well paying tech job. Am I good at what I do? Maybe not. But I’m solid. You need something done? It will get done without delays. I’ll meet the timelines I commit to. Can I code? Yes. Can I tolerate coding? Not even slightly.

I’ve been at this company for a few months now and I absolutely despise it. I hate it from the core of my being. Apparently, EVERYTHING is extremely urgent. If things don’t get done IMMEDIATELY, then the world is going to end. “Oh, done with today’s tasks? Start the next asap.”

Yes, I finished my tasks by 7pm but that’s because I want the rest of the evening to myself. I did not take any breaks during the day because I want to be able to step away from work in the evenings and nights without getting a million pings on Teams. It’s not so that I can do MORE work immediately????


I hate having to wake up and look at that one screen. Just lines and lines and lines of characters on the screen. I feel nothing but anxiety. The lifeless endless list of “HIGH PRIORITY URGENT” tasks that can to be honest, wait.


I’ve had to work from 10am to 1-3am on a lot of the days. It’s just work. My life has ceased to have meaning. There are no parks, no beaches, no sidewalks to help take breaks or spend time in nature. It’s just work. There is no joy. I don’t know how people do it for decades.


I know that this is a first world problem. People do have it worse and it’s terrible to complain this way. I’m sorry about that. I just wish I did something else but I like money. This job gives me that. I tried running a small business but it took a toll on me physically. However, that was one thing that I enjoyed doing. I wish I liked my tech job

Instead, they give vague, surface-level praise to both of us. 

Recently, an executive publicly called out him in an email thread with C-suite folks, but my boss still won’t hold him accountable. I don’t technically co-own projects with him, but there’s enough overlap that I keep getting pulled in. My boss is a big fan of ""WE"" without calling him out.

Right now I'm not picking up his slack, but I want to step back even more mentally. For example, our boss assigned me Category A of an upcoming project and said we’d split Category B. Instead of chasing him down to divide it up, I’m thinking about just… not following up. Then when our boss asks, I’ll just say, “Hey \[peer\], want to take all of Category B?”

I know I need to detach, but it’s frustrating to be in an environment where leadership enables this. I’ve been job hunting for four months with no luck, so quitting isn’t an option right now.

I don't think they'll ever hold him accountable and will continue to treat him with kid gloves.

With more updates! So I had my interview with the VP (per my last post) and the next morning (Friday) he text the director I'd be working under to say he loved me and wanted to bring me on board. The Director text me to let me know the good news. He told me to standby and I'd be contacted by a HR recruiter to start their side of the process. Cool, that works.

Nothing for the rest of the day Friday.

Nothing Monday.

Nothing Tuesday.

Finally I emailed the director to ask how the process was going (I was starting to get impatient) and he CC'd me on an email to the recruiter to introduce me, and pass off my contact information. The recruiter called me an hour or so later. We had a great chat and he said he was going to send a personality questionnaire for me to take. Here's the thing. I'm way overqualified for the role I was applying for. But I'm amazing at support-type work. I'm great at information organization. I'm great at time management. The reality is I'm an amazing follower, not a leader. I don't really want to be a project manager. However because of my qualifications, the salary range I asked for puts me in the PM bracket. So that's what they told the recruiter I was being hired for. So he sent me a PM questionnaire. I took it immediately. It was one of those questionnaires where it asks a two sided questions ""Are you more passive....Or more Aggressive"" and then you pick on a scale how well you feel you fit those qualities (strongly agree, sort of agree... etc etc). A lot of questions like that. My personality fits more of a predictable steady work type (ie. Not a PM). Apparently my answers flagged to the recruiter as ""not exactly PM material"" but the director finally informed him that it's because I won't actually be a PM. Nonetheless the recruiter wanted to put me through a panel interview. Ok fine...

So that was on Wednesday. The recruiter said my interview would definitely be Thursday or Friday. Well Friday morning I get an email from the director with the subject ""Panel Interview Today"" with an attachment of the questions they were going to ask, and in red lettering all the answers the panel were looking for that the director put in (I suspect he was trying to help me to just get this process done with and out of the way). I happened to be running to the grocery store when it came in, and a few minutes later the director called me. He wanted to give me a heads up about the questions and why the recruiter felt it was necessary to do the interview (because of the questionnaire). I said Sure and asked him to send me the Teams link, and I'd be there. Apparently the recruiter forgot to send the Teams link to me 2 days prior...because the interview was in 2 hours. I had 2 hours to get to the store, buy soup and gatorade for my husband who had a cold, get home, go over the answers and memorize everything, get out of my lazy clothes, fix my hair and get my computer set up for this call. I think I sat down for the call at 11:26, made sure the office lighting didn't wash me out, and hoped on the call at 11:28.

Suffice to say I was grateful for the answers the director passed off to me. I was able to say what everyone wanted to hear, and they all agreed to move forward with hiring me (again). The director even grabbed his webcam off his monitor to show me the desk he'd already set up for me in their office (it was adorable).

I finally. Finally. FINALLY! Got my offer letter today. It's been signed and sent back, and my tentative start date is the 24th! The process is mostly over (I hope) and I'm going back to work!!

**EDIT** because I forgot the best part! So the company I'll be working for has 3 offices in our region of the US. One in my state, one in the state south of us, and one in the state south of that.

We usually have task estimations in the beginning of sprints and I  feel that giving daily updates just to repeat the same as the previous day doesn't make any sense, unless you have a blocker, clarification or dependencies to call out. We also have triaging calls and ad hoc calls with QA everyday for minimum 2 hrs. 
I have missed attending the standups couple of times a week and the matter seems to have been escalated.
When do I do development? Can't the PMs act human at least?

That wage gap of 83 cents to the dollar, [according to data](https://iwpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IWPR-National-Wage-Gap-Fact-Sheet-2024.pdf) in the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey, has barely budged since 2003 – and it’s even widened slightly. 

The gender wage gap is typically slimmest when women first enter the workforce, right out of high school or college. That's because entry-level positions tend to have smaller salary ranges to begin with. But over time, women are more likely to take breaks from their careers to care for their families, and less likely to get promoted at work. That's true across industries and regardless of educational background, said Jocelyn Frye, president of the National Partnership for Women & Families.

At my last job, I wore makeup every single day—foundation, concealer, brows, mascara, blush, contour, the works. It took me about 30 minutes every morning, and honestly, it was exhausting. I’d even end up running late some mornings because of it. This year, I decided I’m done with that. I still try to look presentable—like I’ll do my eyebrows and fix my hair—but I don’t think it’s necessary to do a full face of makeup every single day especially now that my skins finally cleared up. I used to struggle with acne pretty badly. 

When I told my mom this, she disagreed strongly. For context, she dresses to the nines every day, does her makeup, and honestly gets it done way faster than I ever could. She’s been like this forever, and she’ll even judge me and my sister if we don’t try to look “put together” all the time. She was like, “It’s important how you present yourself,” and acted like it was crazy for me to not wear makeup to my remote job today. She’s basically saying I’ll get treated better if I do the whole one two but f that. I’m tired. I don’t think my job is important enough to justify spending that much time on my looks every day. And honestly, why should I have to?

Like, my job is hybrid, I don’t look like I just rolled out of bed, and I’m still doing the work. Isn’t that what matters most? Meanwhile, men roll out of bed, run their fingers through their hair, throw on a shirt, and go, and no one says anything to them about it. But God forbid I don’t put on foundation one day—it’s like the world is ending. It’s frustrating and honestly makes me feel insecure, like something’s wrong with me if I don’t look perfect every single day.

Anyway, am I alone in feeling this way? Do you all wear makeup to work every day, or are you just over it too? I am in a client facing role but I don’t understand why she thinks it’s such a big deal. Beauty standards are aggravating. ",user_387,214,324

Nah, if I bring it up now it would be weird because we're talking about something else entirely. Etc.

Problem is, our cto calls it out very often - something like, what do the quieter people think about this, and we sit there in silence, all the pressure on the four quiet people in the room, while I think about what to say until someone else breaks the silence. I'm working on it, trying to speak more in smaller meetings etc to build up to it, but it'll take a while to improve a habit that's followed me since childhood.

It was very unrelated with the overall theme of the interview, previous questions (""why do you want to work in this company"" ""why did you choose computer science etc"") and it made me question whether my interviewer had a bias against me due to my gender. 

For further context, I answered it quite well although taken aback.

It made me think about what seems like growing class consciousness in society as these companies rarely operate in the best interest of the workers who keep the company running and making money. 

If so many workers are seeing and experiencing these same issues, why don’t more tech workers unionize to push against unflexible RTO work conditions, unexpected and cruel layoffs, and overall better benefits while company profits grow every single year?

I feel so alone and unsafe.","Hi, everyone. I’m a 23yo woman and studying web app development. I returned to my degree this year after dropping out last year because I was sexually harassed, and no one really took it seriously.

But when I rejoined, I was the only woman in class, and last semester, in the first month of classes, a few male classmates added me to a group chat and sent porn gifs, one of them was bestiality. I was horrified. I reported it to the faculty director, who gave them a warning but also said she hoped it was just “a virus.” I didn’t feel safe in class after that.

Fast forward to now - we’re preparing for a coding competition in May, and I wanted to bond with the others so it wouldn’t be weird (please don’t victim blame, I now know I should’ve just tried to keep minimum contact). I asked if they were going out and joined them, trying to be friendly. But I recently found out there’s another group chat behind my back where they talk about me. They said they “lost respect” for me after I called out the porn, but that I’m “nice and cool” so they let it go. They also joked that I only asked them out because I wanted to be with one of them, completely misreading my intentions and sexualizing me again.

One of them has apparently been trying to get us to share a bed at the hostel, and the others have been encouraging it. He touches my stuff, plays with my hair, and makes me really uncomfortable. Someone else even called him out, but he just smirked. I don’t want to go on the trip with them anymore. I’ve decided I’ll stay somewhere on my own and only show up for the actual competition, but I’m not sure if that’s allowed so I’m looking for answers.

I’ve supported these same classmates to help us qualify for the trip - I created a PDF guide, helped them register, answered questions… I did all this just to make sure we had enough people to go. And somehow they still treat me like I’m not a real teammate, like I’m just there to be mocked or sexualized.

Today I spoke to a secretary at my university about what’s been happening, and she quietly told me it wasn’t safe for me to go on this trip. Then the president of my faculty happened to walk in. I didn’t want to say anything, I was scared - but she gently told me this needed to be reported. I told her everything. She promised to keep me anonymous and said she’d contact the university vice rector and the student ombudsman.

I told her I’ve already been through this once, and I’m terrified of going through it again. I told her I don’t want to report because the system failed me before. But she insisted this was serious, and that if it’s happening to me, it could be happening to other women too.

I’m scared this will go to the police without my knowledge, specially the spreading of bestiality content, and I’ll be retraumatized, after having been a victim of sexual abuse by a family member as a child and teen, and dealing with a broken system.

Right now I feel like I’m falling apart. I don’t feel safe in class. I want to cry and panic and disappear. I’m exhausted from being seen as a problem when all I want is to be safe, respected, and allowed to learn.

Thank you for reading this far. If anyone has advice, encouragement, or anything at all… I’d really appreciate it.

Edit: The trip was just canceled. I don’t have more info, but it was. I didn’t go to my morning class because I didn’t feel safe, but the teacher said he’s gonna support me and not fail me (this was my last possible absence before failing the class), and the director of the faculty as well. She wants to see me soon. At least the trip is off and one less thing to worry about, but we’ll see about the rest. Thank you so much for all the advice. I’ll be applying it as much as I can.",user_924,199,44

I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/womenintech/comments/1igj4kc/call_to_action/) a few days ago and asked my fellow women in tech to join me to take an action.

Because I’m tired. 

I’m tired of women’s voices not being heard.  I’m tired of men telling women to show up to STEM. And then when we do, we get dogged on. And when we complain,, it’s immediately, “ha! She couldn’t hack it.”

So I'm done.

But more than that, I’m angry. I’m so angry I could burn it all down. I am fucking furious.

**So I want to fight. And I want to take back control.** 

Women have power. We make 85% of all consumer decisions. It’s time we start benefitting from those consumer decisions to line our wallets and take back the power. 

To that end, I set up a call for all of us women last Friday, and we had a few of us join. **And it was incredibly productive!** 

We all want to do something by creating products and undoing the wealth and power imbalance, so we’re planning to meet every week to brainstorm & eventually start making some products. Our goal is to be supportive of each other’s experiences while actively working together to make an impact.

SO COME JOIN US ON WEDNESDAYS @ 8 PM EST. Invite your friends, and anyone you think might be interested! 

The only rule to join is to have your cameras on, just so it’s a safe space for all women and there’s no brigading.

It's just all superficial and transactional.

Personally, I'm seeing more people turning to personal microsites on Squarespace / Framer, uploading video resumes on YouTube, and finding that these methods actually help them stand out and land more interviews while forming meaningful connections.

So with both in mind, I’ve created [Openspot](http://heyopenspot.com) (completely free). It's a modern take on LinkedIn, focused on meaningful interactions and presentation of yourself using what works —  meaningful prompts, video, audio, and proof of your work. No endless feeds. No humblebrags. Just real people open to new opportunities and networking. Your profile practically doubles as a portfolio / personal microsite.

There's already a few employers onboarded, so recruiters can reach out to you directly. But you can also connect with other users and network :) Some really important principles that I prioritized building Openspot:

* **No feed, no likes, no endless scrolling.** There’s no pressure to post constantly or play the engagement game.

Here’s their summary:

> In this article, brand strategist and visibility expert N. Chloé Nwangwu argues that “underrecognized” is more accurate than — and a more productive alternative to — the word “underrepresented.”

> Nwangwu argues that “underrepresented” fails because it shifts our focus away from the leaders, the institutions, and the systems that have the power to sustainably change the status quo. Instead, it puts the onus on the socially marginalized person.           

> “Underrepresented” also suggests that the solution to inequity is for leaders to place marginalized social groups into very visible positions while simultaneously failing to give them the tools needed to overcome individual and systemic biases. Then, it winks knowingly should this group not manage to beat the odds, again.

> “Underrecognized,” on the other hand, invites us to address the behavior driving underrepresentation: a lack of recognition. It makes the real problem more visible, and puts the responsibility of change on the discriminators and the systems that enable and trap them.

It seemed me everyone was talking about LLMs, agents, and what new job AI can automate tomorrow. As someone who wants to keep working, I know I have to learn and get ahead of AI before it gets ahead of me and my career.

I spoke to some of my friends in the industry and some feel similarly, particularly those in Sales / Marketing / GTM / Operations / PM roles. Many women who are returning from caregiving also are now trying to level up in AI knowledge and want to connect with others doing the same.

Which brings me to my soapbox :P - I've now formed a community of folks in VC/PE, Marketing / Sales / Operations in Tech, Policy, finance, and non-CS academia who are looking to learn together in a biweekly/monthly setting together. I hope to make knowledge accessible for all in smaller group sessions, help folks stay ahead of AI, and have a sense of community and connection in the honestly scary labor market we're currently in.

If you're interested, feel free to ping me to join! This is a basic learning group where we will not be learning advanced AI/ML, but covering what is AI, how to leverage it in daily work, who the major players are, and how to set up a learning process so you can always keep abreast of the new developments.

We are both women. I am the lead on the project and I run our standup meetings to get a pulse on where we are with the work throughout the week. 

This particular coworker tends to dive deep and rabbit trail on particular issues. I have asked previously verbally and written down in communications multiple times that we need to come to these meetings prepared to discuss our tasks assigned and give succinct updates. If a longer discussion is needed then those should be scheduled outside of the 30min session to work through that issue. 

They also have a tendency to begin working through things on their device during the meeting. Which then means they aren’t participating in the meeting or we’re waiting on them to bring their focus back around. 

At least once every meeting they will go down a side trail and I will wait for what I feel is a reasonable amount of time before interjecting with the next task to review. 

I feel bad. Because no one likes being cut off, but I’m not sure what else to do. They are not my direct report or I would have a one on one discussion with them about how they engage in communication. Basically they’re a bit of an energy vampire. So this isn’t even a work related things. People often get trapped in conversations with them and try not to be rude which means they have a hard time escaping.

I am a former tech HR, and I do some career coaching and company politics coaching. The client’s primary goal was to strategize how to become a manager, which we did.   
In the end of discussion he decided to open up, and said “Do you know how hard it is to be an Indian man? I spent my whole childhood studying, and then I spent my whole youth in America studying in college. And then I’ve got into the company of my dream, but I still can’t find a woman. All women hear my Indian accent, and becoming racist towards me.”

I was kinda frustrated all over the place. I mean, sure, racism is real. But also, I suspect that he is a bit over the top on first dates, and it has nothing to do with his accent. He started our session by saying that I was really beautiful. I ended up recommending to talk to relationship coach.

It's important for women in tech, and for women in general who want to succeed in their careers, to think about.

I was very culturally open with who I associated with earlier in my career. For whatever reason, I found myself working with predominantly men from cultures that, even in modern times, block the advancement of women, and do not take professional women seriously (I don't want this to become negative, so I'll skip calling out the specific regions). 

But suffice it to say, I found my professional advancement stiffled, all because I was ignorant about how ingrained this negative cultural programming against women can be in other cultures. They seemed ""different"" from others in their country on the surface. They are good mimics. But the more you work with them, the more negative beliefs start being revealed.

So, to try to keep this positive, I would love a discussion among the more experienced of us about the cultures you've found the LEAST misogynistic and supportive of women's career progression. The places where, if you got a job offer, you would jump at the opportunity to take it, just for your career growth.

This is great info even if you aren't planning on moving - choosing to work with people who grew up in those regions can be a better bet too.

My answer:
While I don't have a ton of experience here, I found myself feeling very empowered (relative to other states) while living in NYC and northern New England. Lots of powerful women walking around, not afraid to show their power.

They ""backbill"" clients for people client never asked for, they would just DOUBLE the rate in the middle of the project because they felt like it (with no raise for people of course, just for the margin), and cherry on top - I am now asked to create FAKE projects in the systems with FAKE billings. 

We do get new projects, but numbers from new projects now DISAPPEAR into covering ""last year projects"", so covering up last year's fake projects basically. Awesome. 

Once I fully understand what the hell is going on I refuse to do any of it. I call CTO and softly hint on what's happening (to see if he's in on it too or not) - crickets. I call CFO to see if he's in on it - he gives me some bs speech. I don't freaking know what to do, also, I'M PREGNANT and the new FEMALE BOSS (who turns out just threw the old boss under the bus, so he's out and she's promoted), the female boss starts making my life HELL.

I literally get a warning from HR because I didn't attend a call THAT I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO ATTEND, and that there is this ONE internal email that came in 3 (!!!) days ago and I haven't replied. 

So I take the hint, I don't freaking know what else can I do, so I just stop working. As far as I can tell I'm already fired. So 2 weeks go by and they do fire me effective immediately. 

I've been there in total of 6 months and IT HAS BEEN HELL. Ruined my whole career. To this day, 3 years later, no one would hire me, because I leave Capgemini after 1 year, and then Globant for 6 months. It looks bad. And I'm all out of ways to explain it. Ruined my career, literally.

I love my work but the situation in my team has gotten from bad to worse to completely unbearable. As a woman I have to try 10x as hard as the men around me, and I do that without hesitation. But what stings is men doing none of the work and getting ahead just in the basis of storytelling and brown nosing. I have an extremely unsupportive manager whose #1 priority is to be in the good books of engineering and product leaders to get ahead himself. More recently a project I’ve outed my heart and soul in for  years that is going live soon (and that everyone knows is going to get big) is likely to be taken away from me under the guise of “re-orgs”. As a “temporary resolution” he has forced me to take up another team which has a dozen projects going on and that all need my intense involvement.

I’m in the last stage of the process now and… after today, I don’t know if I should continue.

I’ve been so frustrated at my current job for the past year due to the toxic culture and shrinking promo budgets. I get glowing feedback from my mentor, peers, and even leaders in my department, but it just feels like empty words — I’m still being compensated at junior-level when I’ve been performing at the next level for over a year now. I mean, even leadership has said I’m outpacing my peers.

There’s no guarantee there will be promo headcount this year either. But the job market is terrible; I barely hear back on my applications now when I used to get interviews and offers 3-4 years ago. The level of effort I’ve put into my application materials and portfolio gets so exhausting when faced with the insane competition out there, and the deep unhappiness from being in my current city and job has led to depression and burnout over the past few years.

But now I don’t know what to do because I want to advance in my career but not feel like I’m selling my soul to Mark Zuckerberg. Every single day I check my email to see if I’ll hear back from any of the companies I applied to, but still nothing — even when I check my portfolio’s analytics and see that they’ve clearly viewed it. It’s so hard to remain hopeful in light of everything’s enshittification.

I am marketing, but marketing for a cloud consultancy firm. 

My company is not US-based, and is headquartered in a country already decently well known for sexism. 

The only other female who works in the US, beside myself, had a baby over the holidays. We have no US HR so nothing went out to congratulate her or anything. But I got an email (on Monday...a holiday...) asking me to find something to send her. From 2 of the guys in the US who have children themselves and are perfectly able to know what might be a good gift. 

I am very much a childless woman (they know that) who doesn't have a maternal bone in her body. Cool gay aunt over here. But I guess since I'm the only other woman, by default that becomes my job. 

Of course I'll do it, because my colleague deserves something nice. But ugh.

I am feeling really tired today. I have been in tech for over 20 years at this point. I am from India and tried really hard to find a good job for 6 years after graduating with a gold medal from a top tier engineering university. Got told that variations of ""We are only hiring men"" or ""you are too educated, so you will leave"" or ""You are a woman...what if you get married and leave the company?"" It was a culmination of everything I heard about being a woman since my birth and I decided to leave the country. 

Came to the US, graduated from a top 10 university in the South east known for its basketball, got a wonderful job and been working ever since. But, the fight never ended. 

My company is generally really nice for women and families. Lots of women in leadership roles and I am one of them (will be my 15th year here in April). Its consulting, so I have a lot of client interaction and I have been successful in eventually gaining the respect of the folks I work with. 

But, it also includes Federal Govt consulting. The first Trump term was difficult as some of the political appointee folks would immediately deflate when they see a Women PoC walk into the room as the technical lead. Suddenly, there were subtle hints from some of my own team members about men are better for certain jobs. It eventually died out, but the feeling remained. Then got called a ""DEI hire"" as if that was the reason I was here (by a woman no less). Recently, with the H1B debate, I got called the ""H1B"" hire and that I will be sent back soon...apparently it was a joke. 

Today, I got yelled at for some guy not doing his job. I had to go into several meetings to explain that he is not in my team, I don't have visibility into what he does, his timesheets etc. and that he has a supervisory hierarchy that should be looked at. The only reason I was thrown under the bus was that I tangentially connected him to project work when he was on the bench, so he wouldn't lose his job. With this week progressing as it is, with my women federal clients breaking down during meetings due to RTO orders, DEITruth emails...its getting hard to get myself off the ground and keep fighting. 

I know I will get up and keep going eventually, because that's all I know how to do. But, maybe today I will allow myself to sink a little. ",user_949,160,21

- BART Senior IT Employee gives me shoulder rub within first month at new job as consultant 
- Next client I was outsourced to: CEO asked me over to his house multiple times to fix his computer before HR stepped in. I was 22 and didn’t realize how wildly inappropriate this was, and of course didn’t feel like I could say no to the CEO as tech support
- Commentary on my body & hair 
- On-site visit for an office move. Tasked to meet up with IT team who is part of the gaming company moving out. Their team wouldn’t start the network topology review until my male counterpart arrived. I was told that it would be best to have us both there so I could have better understanding of the architecture. 
- Constantly being quizzed or asked to validate how I know something, got to that conclusion
- Having my ideas reiterated back to me as if they are theirs after being told months previously that my idea is trash and to move forward with their idea
- Not respected by male subordinates who talk back. 
- Male Tone: my work is more important than yours 
- Counterparts asking me to book the meetings, take notes, re-do their PowerPoint, last minute inputs on projects I’m not assigned. 
- Being held accountable for my male colleagues mistakes. 
- Talked over in every internal meeting and being told I need to be more assertive. 
- Telling someone the technical path forward in a migration, being told he did that step only to find out two extra hours into the cutover he didn’t. His response: ‘You’re just a better at goggle than I am’
- Client head of HR asking my boss to assign him a ‘pretty young thing’ to the account and my boss sending me to go deal with him.
- Literally being told in a ‘joking’ manner that I’m being pimped out to a client for reason above.
- Vendor sales/project meetings starting with, “Are we waiting for IT?”. No asshole I’m IT, it’s in my fucking title of my email signature. 
- Vendor Support phone calls - ‘You should contact your IT department’. 
- Being constantly shocked and surprised that I’m technical, smart and a WOMAN. 
- You should smile more, and be more bubbly. Why aren’t you acting excited? Aren’t you excited? 
- Male subordinate on the engineering team: Can we jump on a call, I have a quick question? Me: Sure - Gets on call only to be told he wanted to confirm his microphone/speaker set up was working 
- Taking credit for my work 
- Being told what I said was incorrect or not the right direction by a male and then for that same man response to me is to reiterate what I said to him, back to me as if he fucking said this first (every day occurrence) 
- Fighting for a seat at the table I helped build
- Not being able to express emotions without be labeled: unstable, crazy, etc. ",user_950,159,47

I couldn't include everything.

I also apologize for not responding to comments, it's hard to with the mentality of even thinking about what's happening.

So my company is in the very last stages of getting acquired. As someone who isn't involved in a lot of work at the moment, despite me begging for work, I feel I'm not safe after the acquisition and will indeed be part of layoffs because of what he'll end up saying about me when restructuring happens.

Today I asked my boss very bluntly if he hates me. His answer of course, isn't that he hates me, but he just doesn't like me or my personality... Oh, I'm sure he hates me, but just couldn't say it to my face.

Worst part is that he indirectly said that he doesn't want me to even go to another team, that even after the acquisition, he thinks I should leave the company. Yep, he said ""look for external positions"". No wonder why I'm not able to join other teams, he's apparently bad mouthing me, God only knows what.

He made it clear to me that he doesn't want me on his team and he regrets bringing me on and that after the acquisition (or even from now), I should ""look externally"". I joined his team because he contacted me several times before asking me to join when I had a director from another team also ask me to join and tell me ""it would be a win-win if I joined her team"", since I know my shit and I'm dedicated and hard-working. I'm stupid, I know. I should have joined her team, but politely declined and told her I accepted the offer from the research team. Boy do I regret that decision! Been regretting it for the past year. Tried joining her team a couple of months ago, but God knows what he told her.

So he doesn't want me on his team, doesn't want me to go to another team, and just wants me ""out"".

He told me a couple of months ago, and I quote: ""I will never give you a promotion"". He told me today he's bringing in someone more junior than me into the team and will give him 2 levels higher than me (pay grade wise).

He is literally forcing me out of the company, but why? I am extremely respectful and try my best. He just doesn't like me. I don't have any problems with anyone else.

Sisters, friends, I have been trying to find external positions for quite some time. The very few interviews I've gotten, even though I do well, they end up rejecting me. 95% of the applications are just automatically rejected. I have no connections.

If your team is looking for a data scientist, applied scientist, or research scientist, please let me know. I'll send you my resume. You won't regret it and you'll be helping a tormented soul here. It would perhaps calm his ego if I ended up in an even better company...",user_956,148,55

And here is a summary of ALL of the job hunting advice ive gotten from recruiters and others in the industry.

1. Use AI: Use AI to tailor your resume to every job you apply for. Use AI to find jobs. Use AI to fix your linkedin and fill out job aplications

2. Network like Crazy: There are hundreds if not thousands of people applying for the same job as you. If you can get a referral, youre in. Cold message people on linkedin. Go to networking events. Talk to everyone

3. Take any project: Do some pro bono work. Create a portfolio. Take any job/side quest that gives you experience. You can always keep looking while working at a job that isnt endgame.

4. Keep Learning: Take online cert courses, online classes, seminars, etc. Prove to future employers you arent sitting around while not working

5. Apply FIRST and apply OFTEN: If you dont apply within 3 days or the first 50 applicants, dont even bother wasting your time unless you are a perfect fit. Jobs leave the post up to have a pool of 'backup' applicants in case the first batch doesnt work out. But it usually will. SO .

6. Dont use 'Easy Apply': Its bullshit. If you dont want me using it why is it there? WELL apparently according to a recruiter from Inntuit, its there for reach, not for you to actually apply. SO dont use it. GO to the company site and apply there. Or get ghosted by current employees when you try to get a referral.

7. Im Exhausted: Playing this game really sucks balls and I hate it. I wish my resume spoke for it self. FFS im 26 with over 4 yrs of experience and I cant get an entry level role. I cant get an internship bc im not in school. I cant do rotational programs because I didnt graduate less than 2 years ago. Networking feels purely transactional as a neurodivergent person and I hate using people for a job. I hate this so much and Im lowkey crashing out today. So take breaks and be kind to yourself so you dont lose your mind playing this game. Ugh.

I get on this sub and love to gripe about the shit I get from men and realize how unacceptable it really is. I am chock full of anecdotes on misogyny, homophobia, racism, antisemitism (the real kind), and whatever else. I previously recorded and reported these statements to HR and ended up being the one to leave the job, as nothing was done. Now, I think I just want to keep an ongoing document (as depressing as that is) of every single thing they say. I don’t want to forget it. I want dates, quotes, and names. I want to remember this happened in 2025 because I swear I think I’m in a dream.


Anecdote and explanation: 
I am way too used to accepting it. An older woman I worked with took me in and told me some really foul shit that happened to her at the hands of her colleagues when she was my age. She has since retired and I feel like she’d be disappointed to know the stuff I put up with at the same office she ran. She established a sense of fear among the men by the time I arrived, so they “respected” her in turn. (Clarifying the group that hurt her was not the group we worked with). I don’t have that respect. I’d die for any woman to join my team as I’m alone now, and I’d want her to feel safe here. So yeah, I’m documenting it all and I hope it can either push change or I can contribute some of my life to a feminist historian’s book or documentary for our next generation. I don’t think I’d go to HR again.

Women have a space in tech. I’m so tired of being viewed as less capable and told so in so many ways. I’m fucking tired of witnessing blatant hated towards others and being fearful of “ruining the casual family vibe”, that I don’t even respect, if I call it out. Misogynists are feeling emboldened right now, more than they were when I entered the workforce, at least. Don’t let them get away with it by forgetting.


ETA:

I like my job. It’s mostly good. I just have some notable experiences. I’m adding this in case someone reads this and thinks I work in a hell hole or thinks it’s not applicable to them.

Yet, when you end up doing the job well, when you have a voice and are able to speak to your work and explain it well, and even (gasp!) have opinions about it, you’re now seen as full of yourself, and potentially even a “poor listener”. 

So, you adjust your approach and become more subdued. You still take care of your work, but you back off in meetings and you keep a lot of your opinions and observations to yourself. You make sure to defer to others, as was requested of you, so you don’t come across as arrogant or incapable of hearing another person’s point of view. And now? You’re accused of being too quiet, too passive, and “not a good communicator”. 

So let’s get this straight. They expect you to fully own your job, yet when you do, you’re punished for that. When you then course correct, you’re punished for that, too. 

The utter hypocrisy is nothing short of nauseating.

I have those too. That said, I’ve had dozens of messages from women asking for mentorship. I wish I had time to talk with every single one of you, but since I don’t, I put together the advice I give most often. This is the stuff I wish someone had told me and where I see a lot of early career women have pitfalls. And to all the women who told me to be the change I want to see, I’m taking that feedback on board and this post is my effort to share with the community.

Also, unrelated, but I would still love a place to shoot the WiT breeze. In case anyone is interested, I’m currently reading Careless People (amazing Streisand Effect there) and it’s great. Would love to hear what you’re all reading, tech-related or not!

Without further ado…

1. Yes, tech has its issues. But it’s still an amazing career and I would recommend it to my best friend.

There are assholes in every industry. You shouldn’t tolerate abuse — ever — but I still believe tech is worth pursuing. The flexibility, the earning potential, the upside literally cannot be beat. For what it’s worth, my sister-in-law is a biologist. She deals with just as much sexism but makes way less money. Tech is a solid choice.

2. It’s hard to break in. But it gets way easier once you’re in.

The first job is the hardest to get. Don’t let that discourage you. Once you have one role under your belt, doors will open.

3. There’s more than one way in:

	•	Crack the leetcode/technical interview formula (this can and should be learned - do not try to go in without preparing!!!)
	•	Get hired in another role and pivot internally
	•	Join an early-stage startup where they’re less rigid about requirements (this route has tradeoffs and risks but it can work)

4. Don’t waste money on courses and certs.

Please don’t drop a bunch of cash on bootcamps and certificates. Once you’re employed, your company should pay for those things. In fact, certs can be a red flag in some places, particularly west coast modern / young tech companies. The only real exception is something like a CISSP or niche credential that’s essential for the job — and even then, try to get reimbursed.

5. Focus on delivering outcomes, not polishing your personal development plan.

Growing your skills is important. But what your boss and leadership actually care about is whether you’re delivering results for the business. Learn to think about what success looks like for your team, and aim for that. (Eg your goals should not be like “learn this skill” but rather “deliver xyz thing that requires this skill)

6. Don’t do unpaid admin labor.

Don’t be the birthday party planner. Don’t take notes in meetings. Don’t schedule stuff for your (especially male) coworkers. This stuff will suck up your time and drag down how people perceive your role. And it will never get you promoted.

7. Have boundaries, but be cordial

Don’t assume everyone is out to get you, but also don’t assume they’re your besties. Be warm, be professional, and be careful what you put in writing. Don’t gossip. Don’t overshare. Assume everything you say could end up on the front page of the Times, and act accordingly. (I know someone who was fired for a private message)

8. Communicate way more than you think you need to.

Upwards, sideways, diagonally — whatever. Clarify constantly. When someone tells you something, repeat it back in your own words to confirm you’re on the same page. (Yes, I literally do this both out loud and in writing) Also super helpful in interviews to be sure you’re answering the right question.

9. You drive your relationship with your manager.

Come to your 1:1s with an agenda. Learn what motivates them and what will make them look good. Tailor your communication to their priorities (while also still getting what you need). Yes, trust them — but be strategic.

10. Build relationships with your peers.

Your network is your greatest long-term asset. Some of the best jobs, advice, referrals and lifelines come from your connections. Invest in them. Eat lunch with coworkers, if you can.

11. Teams vary wildly.

Culture, workload, emotional climate, technical challenge — it all shifts between teams. If one setup doesn’t work out, try another. It’s not a reflection on your worth if it doesn’t work.

12. Don’t choose a team just for the manager.

I’ve had six managers in 18 months. It sucks, but it’s the reality of a chaotic and dynamic industry and time. Managers move around. Pick a cool project and a company or culture that seems like a good fit overall.

13. You can absolutely (and should!) learn on the job.

Always aim high. Don’t wait until you feel 100% “ready.” You’ll grow the most when you’re a little uncomfortable. And yeah — moving jobs is still the fastest way to grow your salary.

14. Don’t job hop too fast.

This is the counterpoint to the last one: try to stay at a role at least 12–18 months, ideally 2–3 years. The exception is if it’s toxic. I’ve had jobs that made me cry daily, and nothing is worth that. I wish I’d left sooner.

15. If you’re curious about startups, try it before you start a family (assuming you eventually want to)

Startups are amazing in a lot of ways — but they often require flexibility and financial risk that’s harder to take on when you have kids or other obligations. If you’re young, mobile, and hungry, go for it.

16. All tech is not the same.

Silicon Valley tech, East Coast tech, government tech, consulting, contractor gigs — they’re all wildly different. Do your homework.

17. Networking events are honestly fucking awful and they’re a waste of your time 

In my experience, they’re mostly people looking for jobs. If you hate them, don’t feel bad. There are other ways to build relationships that aren’t so draining. You don’t need to go.

18. Be specific when asking for advice.

“Will you be my mentor?” is hard to act on. But “Can I ask you three questions about breaking into product?” or “Can I get a quick resume review?” — those are easier to say yes to. (And if you sent me a vague message, don’t worry — we’ve all done it.)

19. Yes, there are dummies and jerks. But…? Tech is full of amazing people.

I get to work with some of the smartest, funniest, kindest humans — men and women. I genuinely love it here. If you’re interested in tech, go for it.
And if you’re thinking about product management? Fuuuuck yeah. It’s the most fun job in the world, in my completely biased opinion.

That’s it!
Hope this helps — sending the biggest helpings of luck to all of you trying to figure this out. You’re not alone. You can do this. The industry needs more of you. And you don’t have to be perfect — you just have to keep trying.

I hope the women here can use their influence. So far we’ve seen it’s the women that are defending democracy, most aggressively in my opinion.

Nazi platform- Twitter under Elon Musk has become a megaphone for hate, disinformation, and extremist propaganda. Its leadership actively amplifies and profits from Nazi ideology, driving harmful policies that hurt hospitals, universities, and countless communities. Every tweet, every interaction, every moment spent on that platform strengthens the very forces undermining democracy.

No one should feel comfortable supporting a site that has become a breeding ground for fascism. The solution is simple: disengage. Delete your account. Urge Democratic officials, companies, universities, and media outlets to do the same. Twitter is vulnerable—it relies on engagement to survive. By walking away, we deny it the legitimacy and revenue it needs to operate.

This isn’t just about rejecting a toxic platform; it’s about taking a stand against those who use it to spread hate and misinformation. Close your account. Make it impossible for any credible institution to justify staying. The fight against fascism starts with refusing to give it a platform.",user_961,141,6

Nothing quite sets the mood like the gentle aroma of fermented piss, rotting debris and whatever the hell people flush down their toilets. It’s the ambiance of dreams.

But apparently it was romantic enough for my coworker.

I’m a 28 straight F, sewer and drains apprentice. Which means I get the glamorous jobs. I moonlight as a bartender. I'm not a model but not unattractive either. That makes me very much used to some grey area encounters. I also tried stand up for a couple years (not very good). More misogyny in the clubs than the bars it turns out. Who would have thought? Imagine being the only woman at one of those Joe Rogan round table episodes where the boys sit around being hilariously gross and awful on purpose. Not far off. 

That week's main job: crawling into a sewer line to check for blockage. It’s hot and nasty the only thing standing between me and the drkest depths of human waste is a pair of rubber boots and my ability to disassociate. But I’m not alone. I'm with a guy a year younger than me down there, also an apprentice, and weirdly confident for someone whose entire body currently smells like a public park restroom.

It started with some weak sauce: Man, it’s rare to see a girl doing this kinda work.

Wow, thanks for noticing. I hadn’t heard that before. So original.

Then it was: bet you’re tough though, huh? Like, one of those chicks who doesn’t mind getting dirty. Yep. I’m literally waist-deep in sewage right now. Pretty sure the time for minding passed about three clogged drains ago. But I laughed it off, because whatever, right? Guys say dumb stuff. But then as we’re wedged together in a pipe just big enough for two people to awkwardly coexist, he gets bold. He starts leaning in, says something about how ""we should get to know each other better"".I make a joke about how I really don’t date men who smell like biohazards. He laughed a bit so small W?

And then - because this situation wasn’t already perfect he tries to kiss me.

Just full-on leans in like this is some kind of underground romance novel and not the worst possible place to make a move on a coworker. And I? I reacted the way any sane person would.

I shoved him. Not hard—just enough to remind him that I have elbows and I will use them.

And then came the look. You know the one. The what’s the big deal look. The “I was just joking, why are you freaking out?"" look. As if attempting to stick your tongue down someone’s throat while you both marinate in liquefied garbage is just a casual misunderstanding.

We finished the job in silence. Back at the truck, he says: you don’t have to be weird about it.

Oh, I’m so sorry, sir. Let me go ahead and not be weird about the fact that you tried to make out with me in an underground swamp of human filth. That was totally normal, right? Just another day at work.

Here’s the thing, I’m used to dealing with guys like this. I know how to brush it off, laugh when I need to, keep things from escalating. But now I have to work with this guy. In close quarters. And I’m pissed. Do I report this and risk getting labeled ""overdramatic""? Do I suck it up and pretend it didn’t happen? What happens when we get sent out together again?

Curious what you would do. Or if anyone else has ever had the privilege of being harassed in a setting this truly poetic.

Every January I am so terrified of layoffs I can barely work. I can barely leave the house.

Last year when I heard layoffs were coming I couldn’t sleep for three days.

Our company has had layoffs every year for the past three years. While I was obviously not laid off in those years, I have been laid off before and had a year where I was mostly unemployed even though I hustled so hard. Made about 7k in one year ( in the most expensive city in the U.S.) picking up all sorts of crazy freelancing gigs. Lived on a mattress on the floor with a ton of roommates, ate ramen for dinner every night, going to networking events so that I could network and eat the free food - the whole shebang. It was a really tough year and, while I made it through and built a great career after, I think I have some minor ptsd from it.

While my situation wouldn’t be as dire now and I have built up some savings - I’m now pregnant and the anxiety of layoffs coming is so overwhelming. Trying to get another job while pregnant seems impossible. 

How do I get to a place where I’m not paralyzed with fear every year? Is this just life now?",user_964,138,28

She’s quite junior but I needed a remote job and so bit the bullet. She led feature X on a famous team (think ads at Meta or Gemini at google) and seems well respected if way more junior than any of my past managers

This job turned out to be a nightmare of micromanagement.  First my manager ignored me for weeks cancelling all our 1:1s, but started acting like a police officer in larger meetings, recording my every misstep in every meeting according to some unknown standard. I asked about this, and she said I’m senior enough that she expects me to not need management or coaching 

Then I had to write a 5 minute basic presentation and this person made me rewrite it FIVE times, telling me how I’m an awful communicator and nothing I say makes sense, which is news to me.  I was in tears from stress.  Then I made a minor mistake on a call, at this point I’m about 3.5 months in if that, and she loses it. 

She sends ten people, half of whom I haven’t worked with directly a survey, and she claims they all said I’m horrible to work with, technically inept (this one hurt), do not understand the space, can’t communicate — the most insanely harsh feedback 3 months in despite my delivering a well performing feature ahead of schedule. I question it and she claims people lie to my face to spare my feelings and that they all think I’m awful. What?  At this point I’m so afraid for my job I show up to a meeting 3 hours after a surgery where I was knocked out and told not to operate heavy machinery for a day 😅

Not Two weeks later she starts yelling at me in a meeting when I ask a simple procedural question,  and at that point I was cooked I guess. She fires me the very next day. 

I am neurodivergent (adhd) and have some trauma from that, so this rapid firing is hitting me extremely hard.  I could handle a bad manager but can’t get over the idea that a huge group of people think I’m stupid and technically inept and essentially faking my experience, and am having a hard time moving on and applying to new jobs and drowning in self doubt. I have an engineering phd from a good school for gods sake, and she had 23 year olds giving me supposed feedback that I’m
“Not technical.” just humiliating

I've been working for that company for over 4 years now. I have Master degree, skills, experience, I know the solution, the people and I even speak all the 4 languages that are spoken in the company. 

They already skipped me for a different role promotion last year, this year my team lead told me about a new opening and that I should send my CV directly to the CTO for the internal hiring, he thought I would be a perfect fit. I did, and the CTO called me back, talking about some ""possible obstacles"", like the need of working on site and all that kind of bullsht. (I've been working for them remotely but I was also traveling to their sites whenever it was needed.)

Then he pulled out that decision is not up to him but it's the CEO who picks the candidate for this role and he would forward him my CV.

Well guess what, I found out that they have been interviewing other candidates and they never got back to me. Now I wonder whether he even forwarded him my CV.

For me this is an equivalent of ""not technical enough, although not explicitly said. Believing they would find someone better for the role is just ridiculous. I was thinking, maybe they just want to be sure and have an interview with candidates from outside first, but honestly, why would they do it, if they thought I was good enough for this role.

I wasn’t expecting technical questions on the spot. They showed me snippets of code and asked me to find logical errors or to write an algorithm to solve a problem. As soon as the live coding started, I felt completely destabilized. I struggled to focus, and every time they said, “One more minute,” my mind went blank. The pressure kept building, and I just couldn’t think straight. There were about 7-8 questions, and I only managed to answer two. I knew some of the concepts, but in the moment, I just couldn’t put my thoughts together. They would ask one question at a time and wait for my answer before moving to the next. I tried to say something, but my mind was completely blank I just couldn’t find anything to say.

I apologized and mentioned that I would have found it easier with pen and paper, but that the stress was making me forget everything. It was frustrating because I know I’m capable, but in a high-pressure, live coding setting, my brain just didn’t cooperate.

I didn’t expect the interview to be like this, and I wasn’t prepared for this kind of technical questioning. Walking away from the interview, I couldn’t help but feel completely incompetent.

I graduated with a degree in Computer Science in 2020. Throughout college, I felt that IT was my passion. I loved programming and learning about technology.

I landed a job, got another one, and earned a pay raise. But now, I’m in a position where it feels like the IT sector is a sinking ship and it’s time to evacuate before it gets worse.

I thought an IT career would be profitable and creative, where I’d work on innovative projects. But instead, I feel like the tech field is shifting toward a reality where:  
- There’s enormous competition with people from all over the world. Companies outsource tech jobs to cut labor costs.  


I thought that IT was quite a difficult profession because it requires a lot of analytical, logical, and abstract thinking. But instead, I feel like greedy companies have turned the tech field into a form of slave labor on a cotton plantation, where only speed and cheap labor matter.

- Jobs are often not innovative they’re dull and repetitive.  
- There’s a constant rat race between employees. The competition keeps growing, with more people entering the market. Moreover, companies often hire software engineers without Computer Science degrees. If you’ve graduated from a good college and are up against someone who learned coding through self-study or a bootcamp, they’ll likely hire the cheaper option.  
- The recruitment process is exhausting. It involves several stages, and if you’re rejected, all the time and effort you spent preparing homework tasks for the company is wasted.  
- Your work experience doesn’t seem to matter. Even if you have 10 years of experience in coding across multiple companies, they still want to evaluate your skills meticulously. You constantly have to prove you’re knowledgeable, even if your resume speaks for itself.  

On top of this, there are corporate shifts in policies that affect employees negatively. For example, the DEI initiatives many companies supported in recent years are now being abandoned. With these sudden changes, I feel like a ping-pong ball. What does it mean when companies once supported DEI and now cancel it? How should I think about it? It feels like just another corporate trend that damages employees' mental health. They impose their policies on workers, but I just want to work without being involved in corporate politics. I’m sick of it. I just wanna do my work and don't involve in their polices 

Then there’s AI looming over us. The uncertainty about the future of my job kills my motivation to study. What if AI replaces my job and all my effort goes to waste? When CEOs like Zuckerberg and Altman talk about AI reaching the level of a mid-level engineer, how do they expect us to feel? Should we be happy about that?  

Hearing them openly talk about AI replacing programmers makes me more depressed and less motivated. How can we stay motivated and efficient when they openly disrespect us and imply that our time in count?

The tech industry has become unbearable. There’s a relentless focus on efficiency, a lack of work-life balance, and constant competition with workers from poorer countries. It feels like your knowledge isn’t what matters most anymore—what matters is whether you’re cheap enough and smart enough. Over the years, I’ve had the impression that companies expect more and more skills from employees while offering lower wages.

It’s such a highly corporate job environment, and I’m sick of it. I’m seriously considering leaving IT because this field has become unbearable. Corporations treat you like a replaceable resource and manipulate you with their policies. The constant corporate bullshit your head literally feels like it’s about to burst from.

Honestly, I feel like an easily replaceable cog in a machine, working only until I’m no longer cheap enough or until AI is ready to replace me. They openly talking about it.

Like I don't feel sure this profession will exist in 10 years and I lose motivation to study because it will be a waste of time.


You might think the tech field is all about innovation, but that’s the greatest lie. The industry can now be compared to working on a cotton plantation.

You're not an individual  you’re just like another worker in the cotton plantation, where your life doesn’t matter, someone who will be let go in the most dehumanizing manner to increase  bilion dollar company revenue.

When I saw how big tech companies were laying off people, blocking their laptops, and physically forcing them out of the office, it was truly a lack of any respect for humanity. Witnessing this has only fueled my growing resentment towards the entire tech field, and I’m seriously considering leaving this toxic corporate environment.",user_45,136,123

So it’s Friday, and the last thing I want to do is think about drama or work politics.

Here’s the deal: My boss plays favorites and can be a bully to the people he doesn’t like. One of my coworkers noticed a weird issue with the database, and my boss tells him to ask another coworker for help. I’m convinced that this coworker is his favorite and that my boss is trying to position him as some kind of manager. Fine, whatever, as long as he's not my manager and I can still tell him to “stuff it” if I need to.

What really gets under my skin, though, is the fact that my boss knows I did the coding for this project, yet he still refers the issue to this coworker. It honestly boils my blood that my work is being attributed to this guy who I honestly think has no real talent. It’s one thing to play favorites, but to completely overlook who actually did the work?

Anyone else deal with this kind of workplace favoritism? How do you handle it when you feel like your hard work is being undermined? Am I just being paranoid?

Ugh.,"I'm a Full-stack web software engineer with 22 of experience years behind me. I just ""celebrated"" 9 years at the same company, and I used to be thankful to stay at one company for so long. Now I just feel used.

I'm overworked and underpaid, but I really used to love who I work for.  I honestly used to enjoy my day to day and was grateful for it.  I was treated fairly - as fairly as a woman in engineering can be - but that's changed recently. 

We had two situations happen with the website I primarily maintain recently.

Firstly, the web access rules on our site are handled at the web host level in their UI, and they don't support .htaccess files so there's no fallback. We had a few secrets kept in an .env file, like ya do, and so using the web rule UI, I explicitly blocked that file from unauthorized access - the host even tested the web access rule with me in a customer service call and we both saw it working as intended. Neither myself nor they knew that the deployed changes would actually take up to 30 minutes to ""publish"" and that our tests were, in fact, invalid. The file was not actually protected the way it should have been. It was discovered by a bug bounty hunter, and I got ripped to shreds because ""I should have tested more."" 

Okay, sure, I'll fall on that sword.  I can see how blame could be reasonably assigned to me for that one. (But if even the host didn't know, how was I supposed to?)

The second one, though? Absolutely not my fault.

Secondly, our accessibility commitment page had out of date content.  I'm not responsible for content, as we have a team for that, and I am actively discouraged from touching content.  However, after the head of a11y at McDonald's called us out for having WCAG 2.1 instead of 2.2 listed on a page on the website, company leadership flipped the fuck right out and immediately started looking for people to point fingers at. It ended up being me, and me alone.

The result?  I just went from having my 9th performance review rated as ""exceeds expectations"" to being put on a PIP in less than two weeks. 

Could I have found some way to later test and bulletproof the blocked access to the .env file?  Sure, but I had no reason to think it was necessary. 

Could I have prevented the a11y content issue? Absolutely not.  I had already raised the fact that the page content needed to be updated months ago. I would have been disciplined if I had taken it into my own hands to update the page content. 

9 years with zero mistakes, and now I'm being treated like I've failed the company in a major way, twice.  I feel scapegoated. I don't think the punishment fits the crimes.

All of my loyalty to the company has evaporated because they've shown me just how disposable they really view me in the end. I still have my job, for now, but it's eating away at my heart and soul to work it anymore.

Now I'm faced with trying to find a new job in this job market, in this economy, as a queer, disabled woman with ASD. 

I'm so tired, y'all. If I could do any other job and still support my family (I'm the primary breadwinner) then I absolutely would. I've just been in engineering for so long that I have no idea what a new career would even look like on paper. 

I just wanna code my code, fix bugs, and kick ass.  I don't want to play politics. And I certainly don't want 3 months on a PIP that has no clear metric for determining success. 

I'm praying to any god that will hear me that I can find something before my mental health spirals more than it already has. But so far, I'm not very hopeful.",user_971,130,18

I am in a very small program and there and there are only about 8 people in the class and I am in STEM so mostly guys. It began as this weird putting me on a pedestal type behaviour where it seemed like he thought very highly of me but the first time I took initiative to ask a question while we were working on an in-class problem something switched. I received a condescending answer and my follow-up question got ignored as he randomly turned to the student next to me. After our first homework set I received a no-pass and was told I need to rewrite the solutions to pass the assignment. This was in the syllabus and I am fine with it, but when I went to ask him a question at the end of class he loudly exclaimed if I had received his feedback and even pulled up his laptop in front of everybody to start talking about it. This was unprompted as everything was already written out on the platform we use. I believe he was purposefully doing it in front of people.

This past class he has started completely ignoring me when I raise my hand while taking other's questions. I hold it up for a long time. It is obvious. Also my gut feeling told me to run. He might use any other assignments as a power-trip and it's treading the territory of emotional abuse.

I believe this man is using me to deal with his insecurity. I am a pretty strong person but fuck this.

The problem is that the man they have appointed to be in charge of sexual harassment cases for the department acts and looks like a sexual predator, I already got a super weird vibe from him and he came to sit near me during our program introduction completely ignoring my discomfort. I have realised this might be on purpose to deter anyone reporting things.

Any ideas? I might just drop this class.",user_972,131,30

I've done laracasts to learn php, populated my database in Azure yesterday for a React Native App I'm working on. Am doing periodic leetcode questions and pluralsight tutorials.

I'm working as a school bus driver to pay the bills. I went from 125K a year to 45K a year. I'm embarrassed to tell anyone I know that's a work friend what I'm doing. Bill collectors call about 20x per day. The only things I've been able to pay are my mortgage and for food. My credit went from excellent to poor, in the last two months because my savings ran out and I couldn't pay my credit cards. I'm trying to hold on to the house until the end of the school year, but I can use some of that to pay down debt. 

I'm just tired. I work 66 hours per week and don't take any days off to keep the lights on and a roof over me and my daughter's head with some food on the table. I want to code. I don't drink and I went off in my 10 minute speech tonight about what it was like (good), what happened:
- first job: got told i couldn't go to the company conference because they would have to get an extra hotel room because I'm female. 
Second job: I wrote a clean API that would have been easy to maintain. My 22 year old male colleague worked overnight to overwrite all my code and then told the boss I didn't know what I was doing.
Conferences:  Was never asked if I was a SWE, but was asked many times what recruiting firm i worked for, even at one where I was a speaker. 
Third job: made the mistake of telling a junior dev not to use the ""any"" type for every single property in Angular. Suddenly became a ""poor performer"" and was fired. Despite having all my tickets done on time and passing all tests. 
Fourth job: other sr. dev made 1164 comments on a code review for a system wide update I did. About 10 were legitimate. The rest were formatting concerns he decided were problems. My code was well formatted already, with maybe a few issues in the project total. When asked if we could plug his rules into a linter and run it, was refused. So I fixed all 1164 comments. Of course it took time. The client decided I was too slow and I was taken off the project, and then fired. 
And the last job: I was a lead. I told the architect what he wanted done wouldn't solve a security vulnerability in question. I presented a branch with his code, which didn't work. I presented another branch with my solution. It worked, was much simpler, and removed the vulnerability from our scans. I was then asked to take a coding test. I couldn't use any tools or look anything up, or plug the code into a code editor with tools like intellisense like I would normally use. My screen was recorded as well as my keystrokes. It wouldn't have mattered anyway. By the time I read the first question, the time was up. Told the boss I was willing to take an assessment, but this one was set up for me to fail. I was fired and had to sign an NDA, but luckily given a little severance.
I said all these reasons are why I drank. I'm now 9 months sober. 

But I'm tired. I want to fix stuff. I want to write code. I feel lost. I just want to work and don't know what to do. I'm severely depressed, and can't get my antidepressants because I don't get the state health insurance until next month. I'm on food stamps and fighting to survive and not lose my daughter. She's the only reason I'm not suicidal. 

Advice welcome, but I guess I'm venting. I found a career I love. I have ten years experience. The problem is men. If I had a penis I'm sure I'd still have problems, but at least all the experience I have wouldn't be questioned by default. I just want to get paid to code again.",user_682,130,34

* **Chien-Shiung Wu** – Proved the Parity Law wrong in physics, yet the Nobel went to her male colleagues.
* **Lise Meitner** – Discovered nuclear fission but was ignored for the prize.
* **Mary Allen Wilkes** – Wrote the software for LINC, one of the first personal computers, in her **own home!**
* **Valentina Tereshkova** – The first woman in space, but few people remember her name.

Currently, I’m working as an AI Research Intern, and a few weeks ago, my manager asked about my plans after end of my internship. I told him I was undecided, and he immediately asked me to send over my resume so he could “look around” for me—clear sign they weren’t planning to convert my current role to full-time. He even suggested I speak to another manager who had an opening. I took that opportunity, interviewed for the position, and received an internal offer for a transition. I was always looking for an exit because I knew I didn’t belong in a team where sexism was ingrained in the culture. Staying was never an option—I refused to keep navigating an environment that constantly undermined me. The new role is more focused on AI Software Product, still involves research (though not at the same scale), but leans heavily into full-stack engineering, AI integration, and real business impact, which is what excites me.

Now, here’s where the real nonsense starts (a week before my internship end date) After I got the offer, my manager suddenly came back saying actually, there’s now an opening on our team, and they’d like me to stay. Mind you, this is the same guy who never once indicated they’d keep me on full-time and literally directed me to another team. But now that I’ve dared to accept an internal offer, both he and my senior engineer have been ridiculously passive-aggressive about it. Combative, even. Like—how does that make sense? You told me there’s no conversion, so I take another opportunity (which you pointed me to), and now you’re pissed? The mental gymnastics are wild.

I’m so over these dirty games, but I can’t shake the feeling that this is going to play into my new role or even affect my future at the company. I need advice on two things:

(1) From your perspective, is transitioning into an AI Software Product role a solid long-term career move, or would it be wiser to stay in AI research?

(2) How worried should I be about how this will impact me moving forward? I want to go into this new role with a clean slate, but the way my current team is acting makes me feel like they might try to sabotage things for me.

Recently they proposed a 4-day overnight team building trip where we'd go to a semi-rural, scenic town and rent out an Airbnb. There we'll host hackathons and do some focused work to ship an upcoming feature for the startup. The trip will be entirely paid for by the company and count as paid work hours. 

The problem is I am the only woman on the team. The four guys (all in their late 20s - I'm 19) have all agreed to go, and now they want to know if I will be coming with them. They've expressed that they really want the dev team together.

I'm really not comfortable with the idea. I've only been there for around four months, I'm autistic and also a massive introvert. I'll also add that this will be happening during a typical uni week as well. However, I don't want to look cold to the startup. Previously, they were very flexible and remote-friendly which was the main draw for me (they have recently moved to three mandatory in-person meetings every week, which makes me err), and I've learned a lot being here. 

The startup founders seem used to travelling and staying in Airbnb together on their trips. Which is the reason why they're comfortable suggesting this, I guess. They've both been understanding and accommodating towards me being the only woman on the team so far, but undeniably they both heavily buy into the unicorn startup culture where this kind of outings is apparently needed for a small, lean team.

Just not sure what to do. Thanks in advance for any advice :)

My manager said  he got feedback from senior engineers that I was working at too much at a technical level, instead of  managing my team. Although I was running around solving hard problems that my teams were stuck on. My response after the review was, ""I just can't win, lol!"" BTW, I am a manger and my manager role is 10% and I am supposed to work 90% tech work. I also reminded him that I only took 10 weeks maternity leave instead of 12, due to 2 other managers having family emergencies. I temporarily managed 28 people in that time, and still made time to meet with them face to face 1x a week and managing their daily drama.  I regret being the support backup and with my laptop in the hospital when my mom was dying. That last part doesn't make me a 3, but, hell, I am pissed. When I mentioned this, he was speechless. But said he was sorry that he could not go back and change my score. F this shyt! I will never sacrifice myself for the corporate world again. 

Hope you're all doing better than me this week.

It’s just so disheartening. After three jobs where I was the only one in my department, I was exciting to finally have a team - and am met with consistent backstabbing and pettiness.

Hell, my parter just started a new job after being laid off several months ago, and no one on his team is happy he was hired and are withholding resources and refusing meetings. A team member, one who is supposed to be training him, literally told him to his face “i wasn’t part of this decision” and refused to add him to the repos for several days.

Is this really the new norm, or are we just super unlucky with where we landed? We are US-based.

Guess what? It worked. Usually when we get together for a week most of the days I would go back to the hotel and CRY, cry about many things. It was terrible. mainly sexism and other men taking credit for what I’m doing while they earn twice as I do.

I didn’t cry a day. My male colleagues start letting talk, my manager stopped micromanaging me.

After the nth burnout, I've come to realize having energy to do the things I enjoy and tinker beyond work is much better than the fuckery of workplace bs and butthurt intimidated colleagues.

It doesn't mean I'm clock watching or slacking off either, I just do what's asked well, and nurture good relationships at work. I do more when it's interesting but I won't go above and beyond or suggest areas of improvement, or work above my level anymore. No good deed goes unpunished; It's simply not needed.

I'm East Asian, late thirties, look like I'm 25 and have huge ADHD energy. I don't have a CS degree and basically barrelled through ~4 dead end jobs, am on my 8th job, found a niche I was ultra interested in becoming real good at (front end led to design systems, but now I'm more interested in everything else now)

I've been canned 3x in the first few years with dead end jobs. In the 3 years before last year I kept trying to prove myself or get promoted to a senior role. I taught many mid level devs to unit test and directed a non profit tech community before. In the last 2 roles I've had insecure or threatened managers or senior devs talk down to me or deliberately withhold info. It's exhausting. I've been feeling stuck, but recently began working through some childhood trauma issues around conflict avoidance and people pleasing. Until I build better confidence, I don't think I'll be able to deal with more. 

Last year I left a corporate lead dev role and stepped down as a non profit exec director for a tech community. I wanted to work with a manager I worked well with again... and this is how I found myself in a domain similar to the tobacco industry. He was one of few to ever make me feel visible. There was a growth plan towards staff or engineering manager at first but I wasn't given any projects to demonstrate my potential, I got mixed messages from him and managers about expectations of my role. If I work at my level I'm told it's not needed. If I don't then I can't hit my goals (and I'm bored af with the tasks I'm assigned that are at most intermediate). The relationship has soured somewhat, and he became more micromanagey due to business pressure, so I'm just doing what's asked and no more. 

I started working on an open source project with an experienced friend and mentoring some folks in the community. It's really energized and challenged me. 

I think about trying to do a founding eng role when the economy turns around to experience a different level of challenge instead of ending up at the same level and needing to prove myself yet again, alter my personality while in leadership at larger orgs.

I've been sleeping more and limiting how much extra I volunteer for at work. 

Big epiphany: 

It's not your problem if your work can't leverage your brilliance and drive.

Create your own path and gather your guns!

I work in tech support on a team with both guys and girls. I’m a woman, and honestly, me and the other woman on the team carry most of the weight. The guys do work, it’s not like they do absolutely nothing—but they definitely don’t do as much as we do. If we didn’t pick up the slack, a lot of the tickets would just sit there untouched.

What really gets to me is that they get praised way more than we do. Like, it’s not even subtle. They’ll get shoutouts or compliments for doing the bare minimum, while we’re over here juggling way more and getting barely acknowledged. It’s exhausting.

At first, I liked our manager (she’s also a woman), but the more time goes on, the more I realize she just kind of lets it slide. It feels like no one’s holding them accountable, and no one really sees or cares how uneven the workload is. It’s starting to really wear on me.

I’m planning to start applying to other jobs soon, but I’m just wondering—has anyone else been in a similar situation? Did you speak up about it? Did anything change, or did you end up having to leave? It’s just super frustrating and I’m trying to figure out the best move.",user_996,116,39

\-------------------

**Learn about employment law**, federal and state. Figure out the laws about consent and recording conversations within your state.

Record your boss or co-workers if they harass you on your personal devices. Never trust a company lawyer, and never trust HR. Companies only care about PR issues, lost revenue, or leverage. 

Take photos on your personal devices phone with timestamps, and send important communications to your personal email (with adherence to your IT department’s security policy - which you SHOULD read). If you have evidence on a company device, it is worthless. 

—

**Learn about how businesses truly work,** because businesses are the most powerful entities in the United States, and they are predictable with gluttony. Attend shareholder meetings of your employer if it’s public, and look at the financials — they predict layoffs. Cost centers and those working on unprofitable endeavors are the first to go.

If one tech company does a shitty thing and gets away with it, all of the rest will follow when they see there’s no consequences. Everything any CEO says is propaganda to pump share price or valuation. All executives are puppets pulled by a market that has no desire to invest in the workforce that creates value.

—

**You work for yourself before you work for the company that has hired you.** If you do not have an agenda, the agenda of others will be forced upon you.

Save the tech salary you make to buy your freedom. A lot of the ""intellectualism"" in Silicon Valley is rooted in a mono-culture of rich people who have not interacted with the people who are impacted by the products they build and the decisions they make.

A lot of companies have impact that they do not care about using responsibly. Do not trust that someone outside of you will care if a piece of tech you build hurts someone in a non-revenue damaging way, because (most likely) they will not.

Find your biases and mitigate them within your work. 

—

Before you are a programmer, a designer, or tech lead, you are human.

Tech companies, like all companies, don’t give a shit if you or your family live in suffering or die. They are profit making vessels. Imagining they act in any other way besides self-interest is an illusion you should break.

Corporations align themselves with power to enable their survival, and they will never meaningfully challenge power that harms people if it makes the company more money than strife. ",user_998,112,21

First round, they had two tech dudes interview me, one was actually respectful, the other was the White Tech Bro ^tm type who had only worked there 3 MONTHS and had no degree from CS or even stem related degree. Some undergrad business degree. I went through my technical solution outlining all my reasoning and logic, best practice standards and this guy interrupts and says at the end once I’ve concluded the design, modeling and testing validations I say at the end then we would automate the scripts to run on a schedule, “no you gotta do the automation upfront”…..automate what exactly…there is nothing to automate from the beginning, and why would I automate something that hasn’t been properly tested (???)

He wouldn’t explain his reasoning, and he suddenly just wouldn’t even make eye contact anymore, quickly ended the interview after only an hour and said I needed to leave. It was so demoralizing and I honestly don’t think I was rude, I just clearly had a different opinion and I showed the support for this decision with my technical logic. I don’t get it. HR came to escort me out promptly.

Because I really don't have many people IRL I can talk to about this.

For context, **I'm 31F and single**, have been working in tech since post-undergrad - so nearly **10 years**. I work at a large company in NYC (not FAANG, but FAANG competitive salary - almost 200k base + equity). By the end of this year, I'll have almost 500k saved.

I dread logging in / commuting to work most days though (sounds like a decent amount of us do here). I didn't get a promotion likely because I'm not ""over-performing"" anymore, and don't play into politics / ""getting in front of everyone + being super visible"" anymore. . Most of the people I work with I like, which helps, but I really am not sure I can see myself doing this for 5+ more years (I'm senior product designer, not engineering).

It feels silly and selfish of me to not be more grateful for the path I've made for myself, but maybe I'm realizing it's not the path I want anymore? I'd hate to lose the high salary - so I fear quitting the industry in general. I don't even know what else I would do, other than take a lower paying local job at a plant store or something (honestly would love that haha).

I've thought of switching companies too, or taking a 6+ month sabbatical because I'm single, have no dependents. To explore creative passions, volunteer, maybe even move states. The world / economy feels so up in the air though, so I worry this would also be shooting myself in the foot.

Anyways! Thanks for listening. A lot of other posts on here make me feel less alone. Sorry if this sounds privileged / tone deaf. May we all find happiness, meaning, and peace in our lives. ❤️

There have been a few times I am talking through my work with this other contractor and he says something that sounds like he is insulting my work, but then immediately walks back the insult. 

For example, he was advocating for an alternative solution that he came up with on my project and when I didn't immediately agree that his idea was an improvement, which I do often in other cases, he said, ""your idea is fine, our team has low standards anyways."" This has happened a few times with different statements and my reaction is always silence. Then he walks back the insult by saying something like, ""I'm not saying your idea is bad."" We also discuss his work and I make suggestions that he sometimes takes and other times doesn't. He is usually incredibly nice and says I do great work, as does the rest of the team.

I have to closely collaborate with him weekly so I don't want to be short with him, but I feel like I need to set some ground rules so this doesn't keep happening.

It's challenging, but doable, to get interviews, but even when you get interviews the expectations are sky-high - I feel they expect absolute perfection these days. I'm more than willing to put in some more time and effort to improve my interview skills, but in the meantime my savings are dwindling, my stress is increasing, and my mental health is declining (which isn't helping my interview performance - I feel like a dark cloud is hanging over my head).

I've been thinking that, maybe if I had some money coming in, I could relax a little bit and keep searching but not be so ridiculously stressed about the job search. Maybe contract work? Or some type of part time or freelance work? Is anybody doing anything like that or has any ideas? Is there any temporary or slightly less desirable work in this market that has a lower bar to entry?

....

Also... as a woman in tech I worked so hard for years to build up my confidence and feel like I am ""good enough"" to get to the next level in my career.

No, the fix is dragging me in and throwing me in the crossfire. I’ll be tasked with calming the waters. I’m an expert in explaining that no, he didn’t mean your feedback was stupid, he meant that your approaches are misaligned. I’ll apologise, over and over, nodding as the angry client takes his frustration out on me. Then! And this is my favourite part, I have to be the project manager’s mommy. I’ll coax him and coddle him into doing the bare minimum, asking him if maybe, for me, could he stop rolling his eyes when the client speaks? That would be so great, buddy!

And when it all goes wrong and the client snaps, it’s my name that gets tossed around as being involved in another failed project. Thank you for the opportunity, boss! I’m thrilled we didn’t do anything to resolve the root cause, or expect a basic standard or decency from all our people. That sounds hard.

Please note that I’m also available to have difficult conversations with your direct reports. Does one of them smell funky? Is your new junior wearing open toed shoes and you don’t know how to say “you could lose a toe, closed shoes please” without ending up in front of HR again? Tag me in! I’m not busy or anything.

Here’s what’s up:
1. He constantly tells me I’m too soft and not assertive enough, even though he hijacks meetings with my stakeholders—interrupting me, answering for me, and flipping on agreed plans.

2. His behavior makes it nearly impossible for me to be heard. I suspect I’m getting punished for not being aggressive enough as a woman.He lectures me nonstop in a patronizing way and has referred to me as his “little sister” on multiple occasions (apparently because we’re from the same country). It’s highly infuriating and does nothing to help me. 

3. He thinks he’s some genius PM (spoiler: he’s not) and basically his advice should be gospel. Hell, he even rephrases perfectly sensible sentences in my product spec docs. 

4. His so-called protection has seriously hurt my reputation. When I gave him written feedback about his undermining, he got defensive and blamed his interference on stakeholder demands.

5. At an office party last night, after one too many lectures, I told him—nicely—that his interference isn’t helping, but instead of listening, **he dismissed my concerns and said he’ll check how well I’m doing in 6 months now that he won’t be around to “protect” me from stakeholders.**


My husband—who’s also a people manager in tech—completely validated my feelings, calling him an immature, big-time idiot. Ranting about it, however, isn’t making me feel any better.

TL;DR: I’m a PM dealing with a patronizing, undermining manager (who’s leaving soon) whose constant interference, biased “protection,” and that annoying “little sister” shtick have wrecked my reputation.

The wife’s heart cracked. The room froze. And the woman, innocent but marked, stood in the eye of the storm.

When they returned, the whispers became weapons. The director’s partner and son, threatened by her brilliance, twisted the lie further. They painted her as a villain, a seductress, a threat. Meetings turned into battlegrounds. Colleagues she’d trusted turned their backs. But she wasn’t alone. Four fierce women stood beside her—her shield, her solace, her *superpower*. Together, they defied the noise.

Yet the irony cut deep. The man who started it all roamed the office freely, laughing at the wreckage. The boss—the one she’d *never* crossed lines with—vanished for 20 days, leaving her to drown. He knew the truth. *He knew.* But he let silence condemn her.

Nights blurred into tears. She replayed every moment: *Was it trusting the wrong people?* *Her relentless dedication?* *Her refusal to shrink?* They punished her for existing, for succeeding, for breathing in a world that wanted her to suffocate.

Her strength came from her  female colleagues—the four who held her when the world shook. But in the quiet, she wondered: *Why must a woman fight so hard just to prove she deserves to stand?*

yes, humiliated at tech conference , as a student. 

my college barely hosts tech fairs let alone conferences and I was able to go this one, with all the names and such. 

I saw one company that was interesting manufacturing and etc, massively popular. But no one was there but there’s was like 10 people standing so I just introduced myself and asked what were they looking for in a student  and probably stuttered, (just an aside my first fair as second year student by cred, but they don’t know that so it doesn’t really matter.) 

And the first remark one of the recruiters/employees  said “was those who are engaged and ask actually good questions.” and scoffed and i don’t know if i’m overreacting, but that humiliated me so badly. I already had printed out some resumes of mine but didn’t even hand them out. And even worse when i introduced myself as knowing stuff about the company, I was corrected as stating that the company doesn’t just do that, but while researching it stated exactly they were into mainly manufacturing and then pivoted… it felt as if i was already looked down up, and not sure if its because i’m a woman or “minority” or whatever.  Being first gen and low in come, I know i need to make the most of my resources, but it seems like im so out of the loop and especially with anxiety, and I know these are excuses, but im feeling like this is so overwhelming, more than the coursework or development. 

I was able to talk with a lady who was much nicer and told me how she ended up there and was planning to retire. I wasn’t able to remember her name but at least i knew that the she was already planning to head out, and at least she did say it was stable, and that she’s interested in gardening. And she kindly explain what they were pivoting towards, but she was also the only woman and at least more professional there. Thank God. 


I guess this is how life/fairs/conferences work, but i totally suck at them and it felt so humiliating, but I keep telling myself at least I went to gain something, even though I just wanted to curl up. 

i really like building stuff, solving problems and etc but i absolutely hate being humiliated as anyone does and am I the problem? (well at least in many parts because I clearly don’t communicate well.), but I don’t think it was entirely professional either. But everywhere you ‘ll get put down, so maybe i just need to move on and improve. But it’s kinda hard as someone who chronically overthinks. Should i have just shown my resume? Even though it’s kinda basic? … Wouldn’t that just be more humiliating?

I work at AT&T (not particularly afraid to name and shame anymore) and the rush to scrub the word ""diversity"" from everything in sight has been jarring. First, I noticed our DE&I organization was renamed to ""Culture and Inclusion"". So whatever, it's a name change to keep that sweet federal funding coming in, I guess.

Then I hear of messages coming out from that same organization that those people are now tasked with scrubbing the word ""diversity"" from being mentioned anywhere and trying to find website owners who can do so. Which seems kind of sick to bend the same organizations against its original intent, but it seemed like they were mainly targeting their own initiatives so... okay.

Cut to today where my team just had to refine a user story that removes any mention of supplier diversity on our project. And beyond the fact that this is the first time this issue has directly darkened my own doorstep, it's just profoundly saddening to me.

Believe it or not, AT&T was one of the good guys once. Amidst the civil rights movement in 1968, AT&T was one of the first US corporations to create a targeted program that specifically included MWBEs in its supply chain. It's something they've historically continued to talk about -- that one time they were on the right side of history. But oh how quickly they've cowtowed to the new regime, almost as if they don't actually care anymore and are relieved they get to stop pretending.

Now when suppliers are onboarded to our product, that data will no longer be collected. Sure, we'll probably still work with them. Maybe meritocracy will even work just this once and we won't descend into the borderline (if not outright) nepotism of the olden days. Who knows.

And it could certainly be successfully argued that in many cases, the removal of any mention of diversity is as hollow as the inclusion of it to begin with. They used to hedge their bets on their consumer base being more left-leaning, now they're hedging it on the federal government (and their ability to bid for federal contracts) and their uber wealthy shareholders which are overwhelmingly right-leaning. Certainly not a financially stupid move in the short term, and I imagine no one was actually expecting AT&T to be one of the good guys anyway so... I'm sure no one is blown away by this news. I'm not surprised to see the facade crumble, just a little disappointed that I was right about it being a facade.

Anyway, I've complained enough from my own side but I'm curious if this is happening to other large US companies. Obviously no need to name and shame if you're not comfortable, I have the luxury of being as financially secure as I am annoyed right now. I just want to get a feel for how many companies are folding like the cheap suits they always were.",user_1011,102,15

So our main means of communication is through chat. whenever I message someone, I start off with “Hi [name], blah blah blah,” and say “thanks” or “thank you “ once I get whatever I needed (information, for example). This is only for direct messages. I don’t usually send “thank you” emails. But for messaging, I rarely get a “no problem”, “of course”, “sure thing”. 9/10 times I get no response at all when I say thanks. And when people message me, they don’t say, “hi [so and so]”. They just say their piece. In person, I would find the lack of greetings and lack of “you’re welcome” variant rude. For example, I wouldn’t walk up to a person’s desk, interrupt their work without saying hi and then walk away without saying thanks after I got what I needed. Or if I said thanks to a coworker in person and they just turned away from me without saying anything, I’d think their behavior rude.

It’s okay to be negative.,"I wrote a “negative post” the other day. It was the first time I’ve ever written about my gripes and pain regarding my career as a software engineer.

I want to write something positive.  I have a lot of positive stories from the past 25 years of my career.

But I was reading a little book _Morbid Magic_, (yeah I’m one of those “woo-woo” weirdos) and came across a personal story I really wanted to post.

It’s a long story, and most isn’t terribly relevant to this forum.  But I think this bit is.  The story is from Kristoffer Hughes, a pathology technician (and a Druid but it’s a tech forum so I’ll skip that stuff ;))

“ _… taught me the power of “not coping”.  I hear these words so often in my work — “ I can’t cope!” — and now I afford the bereaved this retort: 

“Don’t cope, stop coping, this is not a time for coping.”  There is power in surrender, there is magic in not coping, for when one stops trying to cope, grief floods the heart and breaks it though the metamorphic power of love.

Honor your pain, your loss, and give it voice, and when you stop coping, do you know what will happen to you?  You will cope.  Grief is punctuated by question marks, but it need not be; it embodies so much of our humanity._”

I know what you might be thinking?

What the hell does any of this have to do with tech?

Well, the thing is, we live in a world full of platitudes like “don’t be negative” or “you have to love yourself first or no one will love you”.

But I think the only way to find real power is to let yourself have your own voice.

Don’t “cope” with toxic environments. Don’t mask for the sake of “negativity”.

I think it’s -very- important for the women in this forum to have a free voice.  Even if what brought them here is negative.

Because it’s only after allowing yourself to experience pain, and express that pain, that you can _actually_ heal.  Heal and see all the amazing, beautiful *other* things this life has to offer.

I once worked for 80-90 hours a week for a startup, over the course of four years.  The VCs folded and the whole company shut down, despite us finally winning some major contracts.

I took that stress and anger and stuffed it down as deeply as I could.  I didn’t complain. I took it all home with me.  I indirectly hurt people I love with my anger and lack of compassion (although fortunately I have good people in my life who still cared).  

I also burned out.

I now think it all happened because I never let myself have a voice.  I held myself in and said “I’m tough.  I can do this.  They won’t win.  I’m a survivor.” Etc

I actually wound up _emulating_ the same white knuckle type A jerks who can make tech un-fun.

And this SHOULD be fun.  It IS fun.  Tech is awesome.  It’s spaceships and laser beams.  It’s satellites and cures for cancer.  It’s clean water and future cars.

(Side note:  That’s the only good reason to want to be a vampire.  To see future cars.  Like is it gonna be Blade Runner flying around in the air?  Or magic magnetic slides like Tom Cruise in Minority Report https://youtu.be/iXpxnxAL62A?si=GBl47K7kA3o6HAov)

_Its okay to be negative_

That’s all Im saying.

Because it’s the only way you ever stop being in pain and start healing.

If any of that makes sense?

So I say gripe, complain, seek community, let yourself grieve.  Be negative if you want to be negative.

Because then we can all move on and have fun :)

Sorry for the long long rant post ;). Bit keyed up from late night cardio.

One of the reasons why I hate my job is because of my team, I am a team lead and have three high-ego developers on my team who have been making my life hell for the last few months. It was a common occurrence for one of my direct reports to leave code comments on my draft merge requests. I have structured code reviews so that everyone gets an even turn in reviewing code, including my own so that one person isn’t bogged down with reviewing PRs over and over again. However, they must mark the PR as ready for review and when that happens someone is randomly assigned from the team to review the code. However, this developer has taken it upon himself to review most PRs, whether in draft status or assigned to a different developer. I have politely replied to his comments stating that PRs are actively being worked on and it is not an efficient use of time to leave 5-10 comments on what may already be noted by the developer. 

Today, he randomly pinged me asking how my weekend was which I found odd. He’s a friendly guy but he doesn’t usually randomly ask things like that? Anyway, I get bunch of emails and sure enough he has left about 5 comments on my PR with suggestions for fixes. Things that either do not need fixed or are already fixed on my local branch (such as a leaving in a console.log). I am already really unhappy at work so I don’t know if I’m over reacting but I’m ***SO*** annoyed and angered by this. Like he has multiple tickets waiting to be worked on and instead he is using his time to review PRs that… literally aren’t ready to be reviewed?????

Interviewed with a great company, had a great technical discussion with my would-be boss, only for him to suggest that I would be suited at a slightly lower level position/pay, but would still have the same responsibilities...","Basically what the title says. I applied for a company that has great reviews online as a great place to work, has great benefits, work culture, competitive pay, flexible hours, fully remote, etc. It's for a cybersecurity engineer position. For some background, I have a lot of really strong experience with several big-name companies and feel confident in my ability to do just about anything thrown at me. I've fully enjoyed talking with everyone involved in the interviews and had a great feeling about the whole thing. I had my semi-final interview with my would-be boss today and it was a really great discussion. We spoke technical the entire time and filled up the whole hour. Even bounced ideas off of each other and overall had great rapport. 

So I was rather surprised when I got the email today saying that they'd love to move me to the final stages of the interview process, however the recruiter said that my would-be boss had great feedback and that he really likes me, BUT I would be better at a level or two below what was advertised and the compensation would be less as well. From the original range given, the top is like $20k less and if it went down another level, it would be $40k less. It doesn't make any sense... you like me and want me for the job you posted, but you just want to pay me less? And he didn't even disclose the exact reason in the email. I would partially understand if he was like it's because X, Y, Z, etc, but it was just like ""he thinks you would be better at a lower level."" But the same job responsibilities! The pay, even at a level down, would be a general increase from what I'm making now so that would still be good, but the level switcheroo just feels a little... insulting?

It just kind of took the wind out of my sails. I was really excited and now I'm just a little bummed out and questioning whether to go forward with it, even if it is still a pay bump. But then the guilt comes in because a lot of people would still jump at the opportunity and here I am with a bruised ego thinking of turning it down. Has anyone else experienced this and if so, how did you navigate it? Just looking for some general advice and different perspectives. I'm going to take the weekend to mull everything over and then let him know on Monday if I'm still interested. Thanks in advance.",user_1018,99,30

I ask every morning (if I have no outstanding work from the day(s) prior and have zero tasks) what he’d like me to do/work on/focus on, and today he told me to “keep working on making a time server”. He gave me this task a couple days ago during another task drought of mine, and I finished it within an hour and tried to stretch out the task for an hour or so more since I knew he was struggling to come up with one for me. 

Then yesterday evening, he told me to work on it again :/ so I was reading the RFC for NTP, then I started looking at other client-server stuff, then that devolved into looking at home server ideas. 

This morning, I asked him what the agenda for today is, and he admitted that this is “the calm before the storm” because he’s busy preparing for demos and other stuff that our company has and said that me and the other junior aren’t gonna have anything to do, so he told me to focus on the time server stuff again. I mentioned that I worked on that yesterday and added that I started looking into home server stuff because I’d like to make one for myself, and he looked confused so I had to give him an example, the first coming to my mind being a Plex server. Well, my mistake because he said that’s a bit too off-topic and I should focus on the time server.

I feel like I’m at a loss, just sitting here pretending to be “busy”. I’m reading through this RFC document, reading through connection handlers that I’ve found in our code (which I’ve done for hours before in previous situations like this), and I don’t really know what else to do? I’m gonna try to make a chat between two clients (I’ve done this in college so I guess it’s relevant and would be good to review), but I swear I’m about to just start leetcoding since I’m very shabby at that, or start studying for certifications.

It just bothers me because I wish so badly that we could have a couple days of remote work, especially for times like this. Apparently, from my talks with a couple others here, the reasoning is partly because our superiors are close-minded and have only ever worked at this company their whole lives so they don’t understand and won’t consider any sort of wfh. I could be getting lots of chores done that I usually have to stave off until the weekend due to my long work hours. 

What makes it even worse is that I’ve been trying to work extra hours to make up for six hours I’ll lose on Thursday for driving to an appointment, which is a whole other thing because they made it out like if I had an appointment, I could just leave no problem (like a give and take type of thing with the company) but we have to track our tasks with 15-min gratuity and put our hours into spreadsheets, so if I don’t make up the time I just won’t get paid for it or have to take PTO, and I need my PTO for a trip this summer. I could go without getting paid but that doesn’t feel very good either. Sorry this sort of turned into a rant :( maybe this is a lesson many people have to learn how to manage?

I do many things but a large portion of my work is not really as code-heavy and more data engineering.

FWIW to mention, I am in my mid-30’s and a woman (of color). My direct manager is an older white woman but super progressive and is normally an extremely nice person.

This company has a ton of turnover in the last few years, and many projects being handed to me have no point of contact or any legacy information documented. I have over 15 years experience as a developer.  

The product owner I work with is not technical but has spoken to me as if I’m a novice with data and code while I have had to explain to him basics like what is “caching.” I find him also asking me for access or to get a copy of things and I believe he is openly trying to seem “smarter” than me while discreetly asking me for help — he will always mention he’s helping me in standup when I’ve shown him how to do something. This is important to note because the product owner was only a business analyst before he joined in the last few months. He takes direction from anyone, mainly my boss and other senior devs even though he reports to the director of product. And it has been setting almost a standard of it being okay to belittle me.

And today my manager yelled at me after I was working alongside another senior dev, while on the call with the product owner and the other senior dev. The specific senior dev has been with the company for a decade. We work well together. I was waiting on him for feedback based on pushing changes to him for a joint initiative. The manager misunderstood that I was working and even had completed far in advance of what she wanted from me, but didn’t realize that I had circled back to another task since I was waiting on my peer. I tried to explain to her but she kept cutting me off, I offered to show her, and she aggressively refused. The other senior dev, taken aback, said in a tiny voice “ actually, OP is correct— that is where the integration is at and she’s doing exactly what we need to do right now.”

My manager paused, opened the jira ticket with updates I linked to it and apologized to me in front of everyone. I could tell she felt bad and embarrassed. We were ok after that. 

I think I’ve found myself in a few situations like this in my life— and part of me just wants to resign and leave tech altogether. I’ve had “tough skin” for too long and I’m just exhausted of working harder, only to get treated worse. I think I’ve reached my limit, especially because I’ve dealt with a lot of death lately that I don’t want my life to be where I’m the punching bag in every part of my life anymore. 

I have been frustrated but never have I yelled at someone. I have only recently started “bullying” the bullies back. I don’t like drama, I just was here with another peer in my last place of employment not too long ago and can’t help but feel like I’m getting thrown this situation back to back maybe so I can finally overcome this. But I’m scared to just lose my shit on a call and be blacklisted as unstable.

I read this substack this morning and it made me think - things are changing quickly and if this is truly the way things are going, junior devs and those still in school can make sure to differentiate themselves in their career by learning now that while you can and should use AI to make you a more efficient programmer, you should still: 

1. If you’re still in school, do not skip out on coding full solutions and debugging them yourself. If you rely on AI to do the coding for you while you’re still learning, you’re going to have a hard time in the real world when something inevitably goes wrong with software (and when things can go wrong, they will go wrong). I feel like I am a very good debugger today because of a class I took in college where you had to write everything in C and you really had to get into the weeds. 

2. Make sure to have an understanding of the problem you are trying to solve before having AI write any code for you. Then you can determine if the AI generated code is actually correct for your situation or not and you can make adjustments. 

3. You still need to think for yourself on all of the possible edge cases and things that could go wrong, and make sure they are being handled. AI is not good at this yet. 

If you can remember these things and put in the work now, I believe you will have a major advantage later on! 

P.S. don’t tell any guys about this, I want to use the shift to AI to women in techs advantage!!! 😄

I think it’s time to leave tech.,"Sorry in advance for the rant, but I can't go on like this. After getting laid off from the marketing job I loved last January due to an acquisition, I found a new position within a few weeks, and quit after a few months due to my boss being the most toxic person I ever met. I started my current position in September, and was due to finish my probation at the end of this month (For context, I'm in Central Europe). 

From day one something felt a little off about my boss. Like many companies these days, I was given little to no onboarding, and within my first few weeks was given a complicated campaign with our main partnership to run. Admittedly, I'm not the most organised person, which my boss picked me up on (Read; told me to improve without any coaching/guidance etc), and I worked hard on this. Everything was delivered on time and I hit my KPIs. 

So you can imagine the dread I felt when last week, a spontaneous meeting invite came into my calendar with my boss and HR, telling me that my contract was being terminated due to my performance. But here's the kicker: The notice period during my probation is two weeks, so I imagined they would end my contract at the end of this month. But yet somehow, my contract is being terminated in JUNE. My performance is seemingly so poor, I have to do it for nearly four more months (?). The thought of facing my boss for these next few months makes me feel ill. I have my weekly 1:1 with her tomorrow and I'm dreading it.

I'm confused, angry, and emotionally drained. I don't want to have what feels like an annual layoff every year. This is my third negative experience with tech in a row and I can't go on. I turn 30 in a few months and am dreading what the future looks like, to the extent I'm considering quitting something I once loved. Any advice or clarity would be great :(",user_1038,76,11

My name is Kaitlyn. I am 28 years old and sick and tired of dead end jobs.  I just got fired from a dispensary job and I have realized I am just over customer service and tired of having to be ""nice"" to everyone for a paycheck and realizing I am worth more than what society has conditioned me to believe about my worth.  I am from Illinois where John Deere was founded and while there's seemingly a lot of ""opportunities"" here on paper, this town is a shithole and a deadend for any opportunities in my opinion.  I just want to get on a plane and live in Portugal or New Zealand and work remotely but I realize I'm gonna need to develop skills to get there. 

I just got off the phone with an advisor from (UIC) University of Chicago and they offer a Data Analytics bootcamp for $12,995 and a $2,000 discount if I enroll early. I passed the assessment and felt really excited to start something new but I want to make an informed decision. I am trying to compare UIC to just being self taught through EDx or Udemy, Coursera etc. after watching some Youtube videos on it. 

I was given a free subscription for one year to take as many courses as I want on Edx.  So I have the chance to learn this for free anyways.  I am learning SQL and Excel sheets and just the basics rn. I was told by the UIC advisor that being self taught is harder and no guarantees of employment, even though their success rate in job placement is 78%. 

I just really could use some advice from other women in the field and could really use some encouragement since I am unemployed and I am scared and really don't know what is next. 

I asked the UIC advisor why Data Analytics is still worth it, since my friend who is a Backups Administrator for a tax consulting firm told me that most jobs in tech are being outsourced to India now at his job. So what is the point then? 👉  She answered with ""You have to always upscale and learn new things and be valuable and be irreplaceable. So she mentioned that Data Analytics would be a good start, and that the real opportunity is in AI Machine Learning. 

I am definitely open to learning AI and everything I can possibly know about it because I think its fascinating and it would offer me job security without needing a man for anything, which is my ultimate goal because in the past men have been very predatory towards me and this is a terrifying time to be alive as a woman. 

Any advice to offer me some sense of direction would be so appreciated and thank you for listening. 

Much love.

Sometimes I still pinch myself because none of it feels real. Tiny accomplishments that at the time felt laughably inadequate slowly added up over the years and sometimes I still can't believe where I am.

Some background on me now: I have about 9 years of experience as a Software Engineer. First 4-5 years was fullstack, since then have specialized in backend bordering on data engineering. I have attended two coding bootcamps, finished a Software Engineering degree while working full time, mentored underrepresented people in tech, earned a patent for my work, and studied for various certs (A+, Network+, Project+, PMP, ITIL Foundation + Intermediate, maybe even one more I'm forgetting idk). I made Lead with only 3 years of experience, promoted off cycle in < year at that job. Within 2 years went from ""broke as a joke"" to making enough money on one income to buy a home in my low/medium cost of living city. I was at \~180 TC from year three onwards. Currently > 350k at a FAANG-esque place.

If that all sounds cool, I promise you that it didn't feel that way at the time. My entry into tech was marked by a series of failures, embarrassments, slights, and disappointments.

**A truly terrible start**

When I first decided to change careers my entrance test for <fancy bootcamp> was so abysmal that they didn't even give me platitudes about trying to apply again in the future. The less-prestigious bootcamp I eventually did join, I flunked the first unit (along with about half the other students) and we were split up with me and the other kids that got 'held back a grade'. I worked my butt off to improve and eventually drifted to at least the middle of the pack, but it was clear my instructors thought I'd never be a Real Engineer (TM), after our last unit they counseled me about fonts and design resources as if it weren't designed to be a full stack program.

Months drifted on. I had what would have been a menial job offer me a 35k offer to work with their ancient technology. When I very politely tried negotiating they rescinded the offer.

I choked in fibonacci code tests. I floundered in phone screens. My resume content was a train wreck even though I'm better at most than writing resumes, my background was laughable. The main section was a careful curation of half-truths meant to disguise my lack of technical experience. A euphemistically titled ""Education/Training"" subsection was meant to carefully obscure that I had no degree.

My only job leads were dysfunctional or humiliating.

One hyper-aggressive tiny startup surprised me with their interest, only to have the CIO call me directly and launch into what felt like an interrogation. After invasively asking about my high school graduation date and deducing that I'd taken some old jobs off my resume, he berated me for not including things like a stint as a waitress at 18 years old because ""it was part of my life and here at S@#$ Startup we like to hire REAL. PEOPLE"", that they had former waiters and bartenders and zookeepers on staff! I told him I had been told to curate my resume towards my current goals, which he scoffed at (??? like what).

He called back after the conversation to say while I was too inexperienced to hire, they could take me on for an unpaid internship. I politely told him that I needed to prioritize a role with pay/health insurance and he interrogated me again, saying ""Aren't you out of work now? Don't you currently not have health insurance?""

I got desperate because I needed money. Another startup, a darling in my area, interviewed me and made me take a Myers Briggs type test, I am convinced I got rejected because I was not an ideal type match for my boss. (MBTI is BS by the way and made up by an unqualified racist, which I did not learn until after that experience).

At one interview for a different company, they asked enough pointed questions to realize I had no degree, and one interviewer reacted as if I had cartoon stink lines coming off me. Embarrassed, I explained that I'd paused my education to deal with a critically ill parent. ""We're sorry to hear that, how is he?"" they asked. ""Dead"", I had to hollowly recount. *What was the purpose of any of this, just reject me* I thought. They did.

Although apparently whatever they thought of my credentials, they hated everyone else's more. Two months later they called back and asked if I was still interested. As a nonprofit they had strict position requirements and let me know they had to specially reissue the job to hire such an uneducated street urchin as me. They also were careful to note that although the original posting was a web/db role, they would actually need me doing design, and was I sure I was OK being in that lane. It was an education & training team full of PhDs. I got to join with the distinction of being the most uneducated person in the education department. I made 54k.

I started at the same time as two other entry level men. They seemed pleasantly surprised with my performance. Six months into the job any pride I had at doing well was completely deflated when I found an old message board post from my team's manager advising the team about me and two other entry level hires I started with. The two guys were introduced by their interests and I was introduced as ""weak with databases but with decent design capabilities"", someone they could give supposedly less technical design work to.

Most weeknights and almost every weekend, I coded. I was too bad at it to do most tutorials even without getting stuck. When I would get too tired and frustrated to keep trying to build portfolio projects, I'd do codeacademy for muscle memory.

The nonprofit decided that I was capable enough to do non-design after all, and threw me heavily into SQL and relational databases. That place was a joke, but I had no idea what a gift they were giving me with a world class introduction to SQL. My direct boss made it clear he did not approve of my lack of degree and feeling pressured I resumed classes. I started with pre-calc, my first math class in 10 years scraping by with only a D, adding to the daily feelings of inadequacy and stupidity.

I remember the point it changed though. After all that work. It was a little bit after a year in. Instead of terror at ambiguous tasks or obscure SQL, some little voice in me started to know: *I can do this. I can do all of it. I can do whatever they throw at me.*

I worked and in my free time coded, over and over and over. A year and a half passed, and after many failed attempts to get away from the dumb nonprofit I got the opportunity that would change my life: A role using modern/in-demand technologies at a late stage startup with lovely culture, where I would learn modern frameworks, be paid fairly, and grow beyond my wildest dreams.

The rest is like a dream sequence.

**Things getting good**

The next job I got, I swear the recruiter misheard or misnoted my salary ask ""1-1-5"" as ""1-5-5"". I got 155 base and \~25/year equity. I had 2 years exp at that time. I live in a LCOL/MCOL city and assumed they must have adjusted my pay to west coast wages.

My manager was a rogue code contributor who had written our entire no-ORM API as a SQL injection nightmare, and built a new ETL application in Python 2 as he didn't know about system python (2 was slotted to be sunsetted already at that point, another security nightmare of a decision by him). With my accidental(?) high salary I was sure any day I'd be fired as inadequate, but never dreamed of not accepting the role as it doubled my salary. *I will do anything required for them to see me as worth the 155 they are paying*, I said to myself.

I dealt with the ambiguity of his terrible technical decisions by taking over everything. My manager was gruff and unfriendly and micromanagerey, and to avoid him I took over sole development of a microservice style frontend, backend & API + separate ETL system, as well as maintenance for 9 VMs that made up our different microservice deployments + dev/staging. And that friends is how with just \~3 years experience I received an off-cycle title bump to ""Lead Developer"".

If there is one through-note that led me to my success now, that's the only thing I can attribute it to. Some little voice inside saying **""I will become whatever is required. I will do whatever is required. I will do whatever it takes until I am undeniable""**.

I started making near \~200k. I finished my software engineering degree as a full time student, with a 4.0 major GPA. I received a patent for something I wrote. I redesigned an ETL system producing something like 1000x performance improvement (not kidding, it was written terribly the first time by an intern). I became even more specialized in databases. I became something of an expert in the way concurrency works in my main language. I wound up at a FAANG-esque employer.

I did a second bootcamp, this one focused on advanced algorithms which I'd always dreaded and sucked at. Despite never doing the ""Leetcode grind"", to my shock I was good all the sudden? I tested out of several sections of curriculum before even studying the bootcamp's material. I'd go to group sessions for algo problems and be the first one with not only an answer, an ideally optimized answer. Who tf was this person? Was I always able to be this way?

The answer is clearly ""No"", I legitimately used to suck. All I had was hard work and belief in myself. Zero talent. Work + belief were enough, apparently.

My income jumped to over \~350k. The more money I made the better I was treated. Toxic workplaces and low pay from earlier in my life faded into the rearview. Projects within my team started fighting over my time. Other teams called me in to consult on database scaling and design.

I stopped having to try very hard to be right, or to write good code, or design good systems. I'd long ago stopped needing to do side projects to bolster my skills.

It is hilarious to me in hindsight how hard everyone earlier in my career tried telling me I was ""just"" capable of doing design, like it was some lesser thing. The funny thing about it is a) design is HARD! b) I am VERY bad at it c) I am actually uniquely GOOD at big data pipelines and relational databases. It seems obvious in retrospect that all that came from ""design is female coded/design is lesser/you are female coded therefore lesser and a design person"". (To my friends in design, it is such BS and I'm sorry you face it).

I suffered immensely those first few years with imposter syndrome, and honestly some paralysis in response to it when trying to get work done. The only thing that helped me through, through figuring out complicated system design or a weird bug was to start small. ""What's one thing I can prove? What's one thing I can disprove? What's one small behavior loop I can get this code to do?"". Compared with people I know who have dropped out of coding, I feel like emotional resilience/regulation may have been the skill that got me further than any technical ones.

**Parting thoughts**

I wrote this because someone asked, which I thought was very touching. I'm no one from nowhere special, and it surprises me that anyone would even care to hear it. The reason I thought about it more and decided to honor their request is in case there is anyone out there who feels like I felt. I can't promise things in tech will work out the same, I may have caught the last gasp of a dying era of frenzied growth.

I know it isn't fair for people who weren't as lucky. I was a hard worker, but money is a circumstance. I caught a stampeding cascade of lucky dominos in the luckiest chain reaction of my life. I had no education. I could barely code a fizzbuzz at first (god, I remember being so happy the first time I succeeded).

I'm luckier than I dreamed I'd be in a million years. And maybe its a moment, and it will pass. That may be likely. Money is a circumstance, it can come and go. It isn't something I'd like to let change me or who I am as a person if I can help it.

I feel like the truest me will always still be the girl that turned in my mess of a first bootcamp project with the dramatic pronouncement, ""I have to tell you up front, not a thing about this works"". So for anyone out there that that is you right now, just know that those messy moments can be the first inch of a long winding path that takes you wonderful places.",user_799,77,14

I finally got a bite via referral to my husband’s previous company, with his blessing because he’s been very adamant he loved everything about the company (he still talks to former colleagues) except for his skip who played literal mind games with him for over a year until she (via his extremely inexperienced manager) finally said “PIP or leave.” I watched him become a ball of stress and anxiety for the year she batted him around and micromanaged down to every comma in his Slack messages. He chose to leave because there was zero hope of them not firing him at the end of the PIP. His performance reviews were always glowing, but he was the highest paid in his role so the only thing we or his former colleagues can surmise is that his skip personally disliked him for whatever personal reasons and wanted someone cheaper.

I was holding out hope the role I applied to would be under someone else. But nope! It’s his old skip. I’m not touching that with a 100ft pole and am so incredibly frustrated.

Positive post and examples,"I'll start. I'm a female principal engineer (and a mom) at a unicorn tech start-up, and I work with mostly male tech leads (and about 200 engineers). I'm senior to 99% of them and my job is to get them to collaborate across teams and maintain a healthy codebase without ruffling feathers. Here's what I've learned after several years in this role.

- The person who delivers the compliments holds the power. I don't mean sucking up or flirting your way to the top, I mean honest feedback like ""You handled that well and I think the project is off to a good start"" or ""You have a good eye for frontend performance and I'm glad I can trust you to catch those issues before they bog us down."" I'm not a manager, but I do hold a lot of career growth cards and I don't mind letting people know it in these subtle ways. Honestly I do this with my own managers as well; managing ""up"" is really powerful. ""I appreciated when you gave me the opportunity to speak on that topic. You made sure people listened."" (Sometimes this is a stretch, but you can usually bet they'll be influenced by this feedback.) You don't even need to smile or elaborate; the honest positive feedback when appropriate is enough. 

- Be unruffled and unapologetic, but also leave things better than you found them. You're going to make mistakes, people are going to lash out, and others will constantly test you (or worse, dismiss you). It's all a personality test at the end of the day, and everything is a learning opportunity. You're allowed to mess up; own it calmly and deliberately and keep pressing forward. You're allowed to not always be an expert at something: ""I should know more about this topic, so I'm determined to fix that. Anyone else want to learn with me?"" Let your drive to resolution be bigger than the problem, and then follow through. Take up space as you grow and let the outcomes speak for themselves.

- Document everything. Leave paper trails on every decision and contribution. Post in public channels on Slack or Teams. Reply All. Summarize decisions from private meetings or DMs in public spaces. This isn't just a safety net but a reminder to everyone of what you do in your role and that you're a self-appointed leader in your own right.",user_1045,74,5

Basically I'd be working under a few different project managers and assisting with their various projects. I'm excited for this job. I want this job. And above all that, I'd be great at it. 

Shortly before Christmas I had a virtual interview with the Director, and 4 project managers, one of whom I worked for previously at a different company. I absolutely slayed that interview. I had answers pre-rehearsed. Keywords written down on post-its under my monitor to help me remember specific responses. I was able to answer every question, no pausing to think of something to say. I even made them laugh! The holidays finally go by and the director emailed me about a follow up with his boss, the regional VP. I agreed, and he sent a calendar Teams invite for Thursday at Noon. At 11:30am on Thursday he text me (something I gave him permission to do in my first interview) saying the VP had a sudden conflict and couldn't make it, and since he was the one I needed to impress, the whole interview was dependent on him. The director rescheduled the interview for Friday at the same time, but stated he had a conflict so I would just be me and the VP. I told him that was no big deal, and if it was more convenient to just have a solo interview with the VP that was totally fine with me.

I again broke out my post-it notes, rehearsed my answers. Psyched myself up. At 11:58am on Friday I join Teams. Webcam worked. Earbuds were paired. Hair looked good. I waited. And waited.

And waited

And waited

And waited...

Until 12:45pm...No one else joined. The VP didn't attend. Neither did the director. I finally logged out and changed back into my lazy clothes. I felt so dejected. I climbed into bed and cried for a few minutes before texting the director to tell him what happened, and then going downstairs to my husband to cry some more. Two hours later the director text me (presumably because he had something going on which is why he wouldn't have been able to make the interview) and said ""Sorry. Not sure what happened with VP. I'll reschedule something ASAP""

You'd think that a bunch of middle aged men who are in desperate need of a den mother would be deemed critical to the VP for the success of their projects, but I guess not! I still plan on attending the interview with the VP, but it'll take every fiber of my being not to scold him like a child for blowing me off.",user_802,73,18

Now don't get me wrong, this fight is one of the worst experiences in my life and I didn't choose it as much as I started asking questions when - as a the top performer - my role was suddenly changed to what felt like a demotion. Long story short - this led to six months of gaslighting, more discrimination and more retaliation. So essentially by the time I realized I was fighting discrimination I was already in the fight and it was just instinct to protect myself and fight back - started with going to HR, led to getting an attorney, failed mediation and eventually my departure (19 months after the start) and a continued fight externally (right now my case is with California State).   
  
I'm happy to answer questions about any of this if anyone has them, but I'm also just curious why so few people go to HR, get an attorney, file with the EEOC or pursue legal accountability.

This isn't meant to criticize or say what someone should do, but I know I never in a million years saw myself fighting my company for discrimination either, but when it happened to me, it just felt like I had to and there was no other choice.

It made me feel like my gender was their first impression of me and that my experience and qualifications were secondary. It felt like the other side of the coin of misogyny - I'm still seen first and foremost as a woman candidate, not just a candidate.

In my previous job, over a period of 2 years 12 people were hired to my department, only the 12th being a woman. I was the only woman on my team, and there were only 4 women in my department out of 40 people. Any time I would mention it to my team, it felt like anything the guys on my team would say would be wrong. It felt like they didn't have to actually care about it, they could acknowledge it and move on while I can't afford to not care, and I think hearing it from a male CTO made me feel something similar.

If he really wanted to, he was able to create an environment that allows women to succeed and that invites more women from the beginning, but the company already has 50 people in it and are only now trying to hire more women. None of the people who interviewed me were women. He doesn't actually have to care, he has already benefited from this system. It feels like doing women a favor, otherwise it doesn't need to be said. If you want to hire more women just hire more women, otherwise it gives me the impression that hiring more women is just another accomplishment for male managers.

All these feelings were made worse when it came time to negotiate my salary. I was offered much less than I think I'm able to get (12% less than what I asked for), and after really hyping me up during the interview process, the CTO really tried to put me down to accept the offer. He said stuff like how I don't actually have that much experience (almost 6 yoe), and that this offer is way more than the average salary for my qualifications (it's not) and he made me feel really shitty about myself. Mind you this was for a senior role. It left me feeling like an imposter or that I'm greedy and maybe I'm not as good as I think I am, when my bf who has less experience than me didn't think twice about asking for the same amount I asked for. I don't think that a man with my qualifications would get the same treatment and it left me feeling sour about this company saying that they're trying to hire more women when they put me down and played on my confidence, which is something that many women struggle with, especially in tech.

IDK, I think that there are companies out there that do make a genuine effort to hire more women, and maybe this company is too, but it felt really tone deaf to me. I can't imagine accepting any position after being put down by a manager like that, let alone after saying that they're trying to hire more women.

What are your experiences with conpanies like this one? I wonder how common it is where you live, as I'm not from the US.",user_1059,66,43

I am the only woman in my department so basically I am invisible if i don’t do anything extraordinary and be a social butterfly which i am not. I am passionate about my work and I was in the end of 20s when i started so i had all the time in the world. So i gave my everything. Never said no. Was open to everything that came my way. Did multiple researches at the same time. I got burnt out once but recovered. And also got a performance bonus end of last year. I was okay working hard. I was okay not being seen. I tried networking many times but it’s very hard with all male teams. I work in germany and we bond over beer in the evening. Also I am an immigrant which makes things a little hard. I have tried networking during parties drinking beer but it never felt natural to me. I still tried. My new boss and old boss were happy working with me. I always delivered, it was all good. Until the start of this year. 

I fell sick. That’s when i truly saw how bosses with poor manager skills can affect you and also change how they see you. I had to cancel a project campaign because i couldn’t travel. And took a week off. My manager kept whatsapping me every day i was sick asking if i was okay and saying hoping i m better now. You would think that he sent to check up on me but no. Every-time it was something about the campaign. He over promised the customer (management fault) and he wants to get it done. He didn’t care i was sick. Stupid me did reply, so that the things will be okay but it put too much stress on me that i cannot rest and i got really angry for the first time in five years. I came back to work, pressure started from day 1. Asking me to complete things which will take lots of time. Also i m the only person in this project there is no replacement for me.( management fault). So the pressure was too much. I said no in so long saying i cant guarantee to finish this on time. I was also leaving for my planned vacation which my manager was informed months ago (again management fault for not considering these factors). 

The reason i wrote this post is today i explained my manager all the things, factors detailing the difficulties on why i cant complete this task in a week, why i would need more time and will continue with it after my vacation. And also added that there was a missing hardware too which will also hinder the progress (ordering or borrowing also has its own procedure which we both are aware of). 

His reply,
He ignored everything i said, it was a complete report and update. He ignored everything and only addressed the missing hardware part saying that i can request it from some other team and so i can complete the task in one week.  He selectively ignored the reasons that would affect me and my work load and always assumes that i would do it. (Not the first time) I replied to him saying that “NO unfortunately i cannot guarantee i can complete this on time. “Like i said” these are the challenges need to be solved “. And he replied “understood! Lets do this task then” and I replied again saying “this task is also a dependency which i explained above. I will try my best will keep you updated “. No reply from him. He usually puts a thumbs up and always always sends a smiley. I know when he isnt happy. And now he doesn’t address me properly. 

He did this when i was sick and now when i was assertive and pointed out that its not possible. Men who are my colleagues do this all the time, they are very straightforward tell no straight to face but this kind of reaction is only to me. But i am not going to be bothered by it. I feel guilty for not being able to finish it and for being assertive but i tell myself this is right for my mental health and i did the right thing. I always worked twice as hard as everyone else just because i am woman and have to prove myself to fit in. But that stops now. My confidence is high because of my anger due to continued disrespect. Some of my colleagues are condescending and passive aggressive all the time. And thats normal because they are men. I have tolerated all that. Not anymore. Our customers disrespected me once during tihis project when they didn’t reply to my suggestions or request and email instead only addressed my manager. I stopped talking to the clients directly now. My manager let me do the talking all this while, i was basically doing his job until now. Because the clients now don’t respect me, i am not taking my manager job now. I report him and he reports to the client. I said no to myself here and put a boundary. I am learning and growing. And i never want to be a manager ever. 

Why does it have to be this hard 😓

We literally got a new project on Monday to work on, we are two developers on this one. We need to understand the problem, think about how to scale it, create tickets and start working AS FAST AS POSSIBLE on those tickets. 

This has been burning me out in the past year and so. When we get on Thursday instead of being happy that the week is almost over most of us are worried that we will not ship what we promised. 

Important information. We are not giving time to dig into the problem, create tickets and actually think “how hard/how long that’s going to take”. We don’t have product managers. We do everything.

Another important information, the code we shipped is expected  to be PERFECT! There was a piece of code that I’ve worked with another team member 6 months ago when we were doing EXTRA HOURS that until now a days my manager complains that we didn’t do the RIGHT ABSTRACTION. How I’m going to do the right thing if you want me to ship a FULL FUCKING FEATURE in one week? 

This manager is also terrible people manager. He lives for his work, he only enjoy doing “director level” stuff.

A few days ago, I received an interview invitation from Meta. I wanted to politely decline because of recent events. Besides, I have a new job that I really like, and in any case I do not want to work for them and I don’t feel like leaving to live in another country (I am based in Europe)

Then, a friend advised me to accept anyway, saying there was no point in trying to be an activist and that I was lucky to have the opportunity to interview with them. He told me it would be great practice, etc. So, I thought that for training purposes, it could actually be beneficial. Even if I have no intention of accepting an offer (if I were to get one), there’s no harm in using the opportunity to practice interviewing.

So, I accepted, and they sent me the full interview process. I have to admit that now, I’m not very motivated. There are one or two coding interviews, and I’ve done very little LeetCode in my life, mostly just for fun. Then there’s a design interview, which I haven’t really prepared for either. This is a 6 weeks process with 6 interviews in total and I have a full time job. So I’m wondering if it’s worth spending so much time preparing for an interview for a job I don’t even want.

I’m also afraid of doing really poorly due to lack of preparation and getting blacklisted from other compagnies that work with them. Are these kinds of interviews really worth it? Are they truly valuable learning experiences?

One last question: if I go with my original plan, meaning that I tell them I don’t agree with some of Meta’s recent decisions and that I’ve ultimately decided not to go through with the interview because of that, will it actually have any impact? ",user_1064,63,126

In my previous space as a clinician, most men get along with everyone just fine. If anything, they tend to gossip a little more and would fight to get into management. Since joining the tech world, nothing has changed unfortunately. When I first met my boss, he said, “so you have a masters degree, you must probably know more than me.” I didn’t take the bait but learned in those 2 seconds that I had to do a little stroking but not put myself down at all. 

“Well, I’m really proud of my masters degree and it wasn’t easy getting there, however, I am sure there are things that I have not learned yet that you are very knowledgeable in.” (Gross)

I usually limit my interactions but lately, I’ve been attracting a lot of sore male egos. In my volunteer role (non profit tech club/society), there’s been a dude micromanaging. I could’ve sent an email addressing it by now but then it would make me look like the evil queen, starting drama. And it’s a volunteer job. The last response I sent was, “I’ve got it taken care of.” I think the next time he micromanages, I’m going to designate the task to him.

In my work organization, I work closely with doctors. They are my clients. There’s a sister team who is on our level who does a little more detailed work with workflows. I also do workflows, build, connect with various teams but this sister team is in deeper. There are analysts who now want me involved and bringing me into these meetings (that honestly, I should’ve been part of it from the beginning). When I got the reintroduction at one meeting, guy from the sister meeting said that compared to me, he does “more high level work” and my role is simple training and that anything I get messaged about, he should know because we work as a randem. WTF? I was shocked because he’s usually cool, calm, collected. That’s the first I’ve seen him in an ugly way. Well, I must be doing something right, right? My coworker said his ego was bruised.

To put it quite simply, I don't think I have the right personality and accomplishments to really connect with others on a professional basis.

Going off of what I know and what my friends have told me, I've been told I'm kind, sweet, empathetic, considerate, loving, loyal, passionate, and brilliant. I show up, I'm committed, I do what I can to help. I like these things, I feel like they're good traits for making friends and relationships. But I don't think it's what people are looking for by default, especially in a man's world. I don't have a ""boss babe"" persona, nor have I ever been ""one of the boys"".

One of my friends argued my empathy and kindness is an asset in a world where AI is being introduced. I have doubts it actually means anything, but I think this is my fear speaking. I still need to complete actual programming projects.

I’m excited that there’s so much conversation around women saying “I’m out” to their tech bro employers, and wanting to create their own meaningful projects/businesses (that’s the camp I fall into!). However, the reality is that many women need or WANT to stay at their current jobs in tech because 1) it’s where they can make the most money, and/or 2) despite their hostile work environments, they generally like the work they’re doing, their immediate coworkers, etc. If women leave these companies en masse, there’s a good chance these employers will only sink further into bro-dom and collectively we (women) have given up our seat at the table.

So while I am 100% behind not continuing to support orgs with terrible values, I would ALSO like to hear ideas on how we can start to systematically support and empower women in these high-paying, specialized roles. With some of the last remaining hiring protections and community structures being dismantled, what do you need?!

Coming from another competitive company, I know it can turn ruthless pretty easily, but it seems different here. I’m also noticing I’m on a team of all women, and I have a coworker with the same title as me who is already in with my boss and already working on projects while I’m sidelined and struggle to get the information I need to do my job. It’s like they will provide me information to show they’re including me, but I’m not trained on the information (usually told their schedule is busy and we’ll meet eventually) or I’m  left out of key meetings and projects while my coworker is not. I have volunteered my area of expertise to help support the team, and some team members will meet with me, but only provide surface level information or not get back to me when I offer help, while in syncs with both me and my coworker, they provide her with more in depth information and are happy to work with her. I’ve also been told that they’ll look something up for me and not follow up or refer me to someone else when it’s actually in their wheelhouse. 

Coworker has only been here for a week longer than I have, and the preferential treatment is explained away as “she’s just one week ahead, you’re both on the same page.” And while we do have the same meetings, she has additional ones and talks to my boss all the time (she’s told me so) and is accommodated. My boss will barely find 10 minutes to answer my questions or look at documents I’ve created to gather clarity, blaming her schedule as to why she can’t meet with me. 

I’ve tried jumping into meetings that weren’t on my calendar, but this led to the team making their calendars private and still excluding me from meetings. I’ve tried formatting my documentation similar to the company style and referencing old docs, but when I refer back to them, they’re deleted or moved. They even slowed down my onboarding to have me just look at docs and put a halt to shadowing opportunities even though I’ve informed my boss I’m a tactile learner (she wanted to know my learning style) and has dismissed me from syncs in favor of answering my coworkers questions. My coworker even put a meeting on my calendar to “come up with questions together to ask our boss” but when we did, my boss dismissed them and my coworker made fun of me for our joint question to differentiate our responsibilities? 

The biggest thing I noticed is when my boss told us about our responsibilities, I was told what I will “eventually” do while my coworker is told she has her own wheelhouse.

Coworker also tries to gather as much information on me- like my confidence level, if I’m dating, “where the hot guys are” (she’s married), telling me her insecurities about being on the team and also sharing some racially insensitive information about what she thinks about men or my race - she is also a minority but it was a radical change from when she first met me when she was much more polite about my background and I was to hers (as she’s East Asian). I did notice when we do meet, she makes sure to tell my boss everything that I/we do or to make a question out of it to show her leadership. That’s a common competitive/leadership tactic but it forces me in a more subordinate position when in reality I have more experience. I just haven’t provided value or haven’t done so quick enough.

Is this FAANG culture or is it the culture of my team? 
How can I make myself more visible and trusted?",user_1073,60,82

I’ve been at the same company, worked my way up to a Director Level position last year. I was excited for the new promotion and had already been filling that job function for the previous year. Right before I was promoted: 4/5 engineers left who performed all of our clients project work. We were hiring a new leader for that team, my team lost 3 people and I was tasked with rehiring my team, stepping in to help on technical projects while engineers where still being hired,launching new tools (CRM) to formalize our customer ops processes and meet annual goals of selling 1m in project revenue. 

Two weeks after the head of engineering left, a new Director was hired who would be my partner under the VP. Within his first month he was no show to any calls I put him on internal/external. Then the ideas started coming which seemed harmless…’You should really be using xyz app instead, at my old company your department was set up like xyz, have you thought of doing this?’ 

I reported the issues to my manager (also male) who told me that I needed to be able to ‘pin’ him down to get the answers I need (we are all fully remote). Teams messages went unanswered, no show to my meetings or my teams calls continued. He told someone on my team his team wouldn’t be updating project plans because he didn’t like the tool. 

I kept pushing to collaborate, asking for support from my manager, and kept being told it was my issue solve. The new Director would go directly to my boss to collaborate. My boss would shit on me every week for not closing out things he forgot to complete, not being able to get answers from the new director that wouldn’t answer me. My stress increased, I started crying daily, I felt like I was going crazy - motivation was lost and I kept trying to push through. During this time my boss told me that I needed pressure to become a diamond. 

My team exceeding our q4 goals on project revenue and our annual goal multi year contract renewals. My first meeting of the year was a 1:1 with my boss which I was told that I would be moving under the new director because I needed more day to day support.l and that I don’t bring him solutions just problems. A necessary reorganization where the only CHANGE was moving me below another Director. The new Director now answers all my teams messages and shows up to my calls.

Recently they proposed a 4-day overnight team building trip where we'd go to a semi-rural, scenic town and rent out an Airbnb. There we'll host hackathons and do some focused work to ship an upcoming feature for the startup. The trip will be entirely paid for by the company and count as paid work hours. 

The problem is I am the only woman on the team. The four guys (all in their late 20s - I'm 19) have all agreed to go, and now they want to know if I will be coming with them. They've expressed that they really want the dev team together.

I'm really not comfortable with the idea. I've only been there for around four months, I'm autistic and also a massive introvert. I'll also add that this will be happening during a typical uni week as well. However, I don't want to look cold to the startup. Previously, they were very flexible and remote-friendly which was the main draw for me (they have recently moved to three mandatory in-person meetings every week, which makes me err), and I've learned a lot being here. 

The startup founders seem used to travelling and staying in Airbnb together on their trips. Which is the reason why they're comfortable suggesting this, I guess. They've both been understanding and accommodating towards me being the only woman on the team so far, but undeniably they both heavily buy into the unicorn startup culture where this kind of outings is apparently needed for a small, lean team.

Just not sure what to do. Thanks in advance for any advice :)

I feel so frustrated  like, I have told you what's wrong, I have given you proof, ways to solve it in 3-4 different ways, heck am certified to do these things.

But when it comes to women PM/ Architect/ SWE they genuinely listen to me, even if they think its not worth their time, they work on the solutions i give, and we have a better outcome. 

Even when i review their codes, their coding is sub par honestly in terms of security. Its not like every man is not good, but there are enough number of them which i can make a conclusion from. It frustrates me so much

The responses were jaw-dropping. Judging by that post, most women in this sub don't welcome non-STEM women, even if they work in tech. The implication is that those of us who don't serve in engineering roles are not ""in tech"" and just want participation trophies.

I am not asking for a participation trophy. I joined this group not because I think I am technical, nor do I pretend to be. I joined it because I write about tech, which means I have a better understanding of tech than most people, but I still couldn't code my way out of a wet paper bag.

Regardless of my role, I face many of the same issues you more technically inclined women do, such as sexism and ageism. Hell, the marketing department at our SaaS company is 80 percent men, and with three exceptions, they are all under 40! The only department that isn't completely male-dominated is HR.

Beyond that, writing about tech is considered a niche, and it's difficult to break out of a niche unless you have a portfolio related to the industry you are applying to. So, like it or not, I'm sort of stuck with you.

Here's a reminder of what the group is about:

# A place for women in tech to connect, support each other, and find community.

# Our subreddit is a place for Women in Tech to connect and share ideas. Let's keep it a fun and supportive community!

# This subreddit was created as a safe and supportive space for women (cis and trans) and non-binary individuals who identify with the women’s community in tech.

If you want to commune solely with your STEM peers, I totally get it, but there are more specifically defined subreddits. Can we at least be kind and supportive on this sub? It's hard enough out there for binary and non-binary women, especially in the tech industry. Why should we make it harder?",user_821,766,272

I understand if you cannot read the whole thing based on that, but if you do, thank you.

I am exhausted. But more than anything, I am scared. That’s not because I am afraid of working hard. I have done that my whole life. I am scared because after everything I have fought for, everything I have built for myself, the thing I value most, my independence, feels like it is slipping through my fingers.

I grew up in a very traditional family. The path defined for me and my sister was clear: finish college, get married, and settle into the life everyone else had chosen for us. And for a long time, I accepted that. I did not know there was anything else. I studied hard, I followed the rules, never rebelled and I believed authority was never to be questioned. The idea that I could shape my own future seemed too distant to even dream about.

That changed the night my father threw us out of the house because my mother fought for for a little money to get her parents checked by a doctor in the city. We sat outside in the middle of the night, with no one to call and nowhere to go. I turned to her and asked, why had she not made something of herself? How could she not have seen this coming? How could she have let this happen to us? But it was not her fault. She had no choice. She could not leave. She had no way to build a life outside of the one she had been given.

For the first time, I questioned everything I had been taught to accept. In that moment, I saw not just what had been done to her, but what might happen to me if I did not fight harder. When I was about to finish college, sitting alone in my hostel room, I made a decision that changed everything. I applied to every graduate school that offered free applications. I did not know how I would pay for it, or even if I would be allowed to go. But I knew I had to try. I had to try and get out.

Against all odds, I got into NYU. I did not know how to tell my father, so I left the admission letter with a note where he usually sat in the house. He was furious. He said that if I wanted to go, it could only be after marriage, and only if my husband allowed it. But my mother, who had fought her own battles for me, refused to let that be the end of it. She pulled together every penny she had saved to buy me clothes and supplies for graduate school. Her brother, who has a son of his own to support, helped me apply for a student loan and gave me money. Even then, until a week before I was supposed to leave, I was not sure if I would actually be able to go. In the end, it did not make sense for my father to deny me after I had already been admitted. Reluctantly, he came to terms with it. And somehow, I got to leave.

Since then, I have worked hard to build my own path. I found internships. I took on-campus jobs. I taught myself new skills. I built my career carefully, step by step, without shortcuts and without guarantees. I have never spoken about my background anywhere, not in my SOP to NYU and not to get any of the jobs. I did not want pity. I wanted to stand on my own merit and to be seen simply as someone who was good at what she did. Today, I work at a small startup, just four people including me. I met the CEO at a meetup, and he gave me a chance to learn and prove myself. Now, I am trusted enough for them to vouch for me. I am given real ownership. And I am proud of the work I have done.

But they simply do not have the resources to give me a full-time job once I graduate in May. So I have been applying for months now reaching out to people, showing up every day, trying to showcase what I can bring. I have reached out to companies I genuinely admire, companies where my experience could actually contribute, and even made technical interest videos on challenges I would love to work on. And still, mostly, I am met with silence. It feels like the world is telling me I am not even worth a reply.

It is heartbreaking to get buried under bots and thousands of insincere applications, not knowing if anyone even sees you. Somewhere along the way, the humanness of work, of effort, of people trying to build a life and the stories behind them seem to have been stripped away. I have no friends I can turn to even to talk about this because every ounce of my energy is spent trying to build this life. I look in the mirror and I barely recognize myself anymore. I am tired of searching. I am tired of screaming into the void, just for someone to notice I am here. I haven't eaten in days out of fear. I have completely let go of myself. I can barely even finish writing this. 

My sister calls me every day. She followed what I did and cleared one of the most competitive exams in the country I come from and she got into a really good grad school. She needs a laptop, supplies, support to get started. My cousin brother is about to enter high school and my mother’s family can barely afford the basics. He looks up to me because of everything I have accomplished, and I promised him that I would help him stay in school. I keep going because they believe in me. Because I cannot let them down. Because they are part of the reason I am still fighting. I was confident I would get a job because I am good at what I do. I have the skills. I thought someone would see that. But I was wrong. 

And now I am scared of losing my financial independence. I am scared of being forced back into a life where I have no say over myself. I am scared of losing everything I fought so hard to build. I can't stand up to my father if I don't have the money to support myself. That is why I am writing all of this today because carrying this story alone is becoming unbearable. I want a chance. I am not asking for pity. I am proud of the life I have built with my own hands, with my own merit. I am looking for a conversation with a human being to show what I can bring. And more than anything, this is not just a job to me it is the life I fought to create. It is the life I am still fighting for.

If you are reading this and know someone who might be able to help, even just by pointing me in the right direction, it would mean more than I can ever put in words.

I work at a big company which may help me transition to a top bank for data science/analysis (but they probably would reject me from finance roles at this point).

In what circumstances does it make sense to apologize? If someone is disappointed or if you intentionally chose to do something that would make them upset, even if you felt you had no choice for your own survival? Sometimes I feel that apologies will empower other people to be cruel or manipulative, instead of improving or maintaining the working relationship. This is what I've seen, but not always.

This time period captures some of the biggest shifts in technology: the rise of personal computers, the dot-com boom, the birth of the internet, and the spread of smartphones around the world. It also marks a major change in our field itself — from a profession dominated by men to one where women are the majority.

Your story matters. Your experience needs to be part of this history. This project is about making sure we — the women who lived it — are the ones telling our own story. We don't want others to speak for us.

If you worked in technical communication during this time, we invite you to share your journey. Help us make sure this history is preserved, in our own voices.

I made a throwaway account to gain some advice. This is my first time posting so I hope I did everything right. 😅 I was going to post on a larger subreddit but I don’t have karma points yet. 🥲

My girl friend and I are planning to move to North Carolina in the summer of 2026, and I’d love some advice from other women in tech, especially those familiar with the area. My mom recommended looking into the Research Triangle (Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill), and I’m trying to figure out which companies or opportunities I should keep an eye on.

**Where I’m at now:**
I’m currently a senior in mechanical engineering and on track to graduate in December 2025. By then, I’ll have completed two internships. This summer, I’ll be working at a company that uses robotics to weld corral pens and metal cow feeders. I’ll be working on the design side, specifically developing a diamond-printed sheet metal for truck beds. My boss encourages hands-on experience, so I’ll also be spending time on the manufacturing floor.

**Academics:**
GPA: 3.79
I’m a bit of an academic at heart. I was previously at a school where I could’ve done a 4+1 master’s program, but I transferred. I’m still open to grad school in the future, especially if a company might help fund it.
My senior design project is an automated rotary car parking system, and I’m incredibly passionate about it. We just wrapped up our final presentation, and our team crushed it!

**Career Goals:**
I’d love to work in robotics—whether that’s animatronics, biomedical devices like prosthetics, or industrial automation.
I’m also drawn to companies with international locations or travel opportunities related to automation.

**Concerns:**
I know many companies want 1–3 years of experience, and I’m a bit nervous about being new to the field.
I’m wary of joining a company with a “tech-bro” culture.
I want to move up the ladder but worry about the glass ceiling.
Long-term, I’d love to work abroad, but I also worry about running into gender bias or misogyny in certain places.

**Question:**
Does anyone have tips for companies to check out, how to navigate the job search, or just general advice for making this transition? I’d really appreciate any insight from women already working in the field! 💖🎀",user_1089,3,0

My partner got laid off a year ago and has some terrible workplace trauma, so I have been supporting us in the meantime.

The company that I work for is a start up and after being funded by a VC, we have had multiple layoffs. The team is literally being shaved to the bone and I have not gotten a raise in 3 years, nor a promotion. Despite being told and obtaining written formal submission by my ex-manager. With that, I have had 8 managerial changes and more than half of them were laid off.

I knew that I have no future there, so I started applying for jobs passively.

Anyway, last week, I got an opportunity to interview with the hiring manager sending me a separate email about how I am an interesting prospect. It felt really exciting cause there was finally an out.

Then in the span of a day, there was another layoff, more meetings about new added responsibilities and now, an eviction looming on my head because apartment inspectors came to find black mold in one of our bathroom. I. JUST. CANT. I also have to emotionally manage my partner who is collapsing under this stress through no fault of their own. It is a mix of the current political environment, economy and this new thing.

I tried to read up and prep for the interview for next week, along with the printed JD. Wanted to watch videos of the associated products to better have a conversation with the hiring manager. My brain is resisting comprehending this information and I have only had 3 hours of sleep because of worries.

To note, I also can't postpone the interview because of timelines drawn out by the hiring manager of when they want to hire by.

Hmm, does anyone have a strategy on how to get over this slump? I really want to ace this, I really want to move on from my present company 💀",user_1090,32,10

This is my first time posting on Reddit; I finally gathered the courage to post.

I am an international student (27F) on an F1 visa (from India) in the US. I graduated in May 2023, and I joined a startup (8-10 people) in early 2024 and was hired as a designer. I was told my boss will file for my H1-B next year (i.e., 2025), as they usually file after an employee has completed 1 year in the company. I took this job to save my visa status, like any other international student would do.

2-3 months passed by, and my role transitioned to PM along with design. Again 1-2 months passed by, and my boss (M) said I also needed to help with business operations as it's a startup and one has to wear multiple hats. I did, because Visa. (Keep in mind the workplace and my boss have been toxic throughout the entire time, **micromanaging, minimum pay, in the office every day 5 times a week when it's only me working from this location, no benefits, no PTO except public holidays**, etc.).

Now fast forward to early 2025. I asked for H1b filing, and he said he could not, as the company did not do very well. I insisted numerous times, but there was no support whatsoever. **This whole April month I was dumped with so much of manual business work that I had to work 9 am to either 8 pm/9 pm or sometimes till 10 pm—all from the office.** And still I got scolded every day for the entire month for it. Along with this, I still do PM+design work on the side.

I fell ill due to this, and I am exhausted; my body and my mental health are drained. I am in a tough spot in that I don't have much savings, and if I resign, I will have 5 months in the US to find a job. I can go to my friend's place to stay if I decide to resign, but again, I also have to pay a monthly installment for my education loan. In the past 1.5 years I have been doing this job and looking for a job simultaneously, but at this point, I am exhausted with this situation and workplace and get anxiety attacks due to everything.

I am not sure what to do. **Any advice is greatly appreciated, as well as any referrals for Product Design or Product Management jobs. Appreciate help in any form.**

Even though both of us have the same years of experience, the other senior (let’s call him Adam) has been given the team lead role by default because he is considered ""seniormost.""

I’ve worked with Adam before and know him to be very political, cunning, and toxic. He undermines teammates subtly while maintaining a good image with leadership.
I'm concerned that no matter how much hard work I put in, he will outshine me through politics, which could hurt my growth and mental well-being.

Switching jobs isn't on the table for now, so I want to be smart about this.

I'm thinking of proactively talking to my new manager — focusing only on myself — by discussing my growth plans, the type of projects I want to own, and where I want to head professionally.
I don't want to badmouth Adam, but I also don't want to be caught off guard by the games he might play.

Tactically speaking, would this be a good move?
Should I also explicitly ask for clear deliverables or ownership areas that can make my contributions visible and measurable?

I do many things but a large portion of my work is not really as code-heavy and more data engineering.

FWIW to mention, I am in my mid-30’s and a woman (of color). My direct manager is an older white woman but super progressive and is normally an extremely nice person.

This company has a ton of turnover in the last few years, and many projects being handed to me have no point of contact or any legacy information documented. I have over 15 years experience as a developer.  

The product owner I work with is not technical but has spoken to me as if I’m a novice with data and code while I have had to explain to him basics like what is “caching.” I find him also asking me for access or to get a copy of things and I believe he is openly trying to seem “smarter” than me while discreetly asking me for help — he will always mention he’s helping me in standup when I’ve shown him how to do something. This is important to note because the product owner was only a business analyst before he joined in the last few months. He takes direction from anyone, mainly my boss and other senior devs even though he reports to the director of product. And it has been setting almost a standard of it being okay to belittle me.

And today my manager yelled at me after I was working alongside another senior dev, while on the call with the product owner and the other senior dev. The specific senior dev has been with the company for a decade. We work well together. I was waiting on him for feedback based on pushing changes to him for a joint initiative. The manager misunderstood that I was working and even had completed far in advance of what she wanted from me, but didn’t realize that I had circled back to another task since I was waiting on my peer. I tried to explain to her but she kept cutting me off, I offered to show her, and she aggressively refused. The other senior dev, taken aback, said in a tiny voice “ actually, OP is correct— that is where the integration is at and she’s doing exactly what we need to do right now.”

My manager paused, opened the jira ticket with updates I linked to it and apologized to me in front of everyone. I could tell she felt bad and embarrassed. We were ok after that. 

I think I’ve found myself in a few situations like this in my life— and part of me just wants to resign and leave tech altogether. I’ve had “tough skin” for too long and I’m just exhausted of working harder, only to get treated worse. I think I’ve reached my limit, especially because I’ve dealt with a lot of death lately that I don’t want my life to be where I’m the punching bag in every part of my life anymore. 

I have been frustrated but never have I yelled at someone. I have only recently started “bullying” the bullies back. I don’t like drama, I just was here with another peer in my last place of employment not too long ago and can’t help but feel like I’m getting thrown this situation back to back maybe so I can finally overcome this. But I’m scared to just lose my shit on a call and be blacklisted as unstable.

No, it’s not expecting the project manager to listen more than he talks, or stop saying obviously insulting things to the clients he’s working with. Don’t be silly. How could you expect a technical person to interact with another person in a humane and collaborative way?

No, the fix is dragging me in and throwing me in the crossfire. I’ll be tasked with calming the waters. I’m an expert in explaining that no, he didn’t mean your feedback was stupid, he meant that your approaches are misaligned. I’ll apologise, over and over, nodding as the angry client takes his frustration out on me. Then! And this is my favourite part, I have to be the project manager’s mommy. I’ll coax him and coddle him into doing the bare minimum, asking him if maybe, for me, could he stop rolling his eyes when the client speaks? That would be so great, buddy!

And when it all goes wrong and the client snaps, it’s my name that gets tossed around as being involved in another failed project. Thank you for the opportunity, boss! I’m thrilled we didn’t do anything to resolve the root cause, or expect a basic standard or decency from all our people. That sounds hard.

Please note that I’m also available to have difficult conversations with your direct reports. Does one of them smell funky?

Alright, I had to get that out before I meet my boss to explain that this isn’t going to continue. I’m such a sucker for someone asking me to help, but not anymore.

It's important for women in tech, and for women in general who want to succeed in their careers, to think about.

I was very culturally open with who I associated with earlier in my career. For whatever reason, I found myself working with predominantly men from cultures that, even in modern times, block the advancement of women, and do not take professional women seriously (I don't want this to become negative, so I'll skip calling out the specific regions). 

But suffice it to say, I found my professional advancement stiffled, all because I was ignorant about how ingrained this negative cultural programming against women can be in other cultures. They seemed ""different"" from others in their country on the surface. They are good mimics. But the more you work with them, the more negative beliefs start being revealed.

So, to try to keep this positive, I would love a discussion among the more experienced of us about the cultures you've found the LEAST misogynistic and supportive of women's career progression. The places where, if you got a job offer, you would jump at the opportunity to take it, just for your career growth.

This is great info even if you aren't planning on moving - choosing to work with people who grew up in those regions can be a better bet too.

My answer:
While I don't have a ton of experience here, I found myself feeling very empowered (relative to other states) while living in NYC and northern New England. Lots of powerful women walking around, not afraid to show their power.

5. Within 90 days, this will also go for existing consent judgements and permanent injunctions.

I’ve sort of grin and beared abuse, I didn’t feel like anyone will take my side and thought maybe if I work hard enough, I prove myself and it will change. Didn’t work. I burned out.

It took me 2 years to stop feeling terrified to do my job, but thing is.. I’m in my late 30s, promotion seems impossible, wherever I work there seems no place for me to grow. Worst - I stopped working for fun, or in my free time and I’m too slow to be brilliant just working in my work time. I feel like I’m legit not good enough. More often than not, I get overwhelmed with work. 

I go to therapy. 

Therapist convinced me to downshift, so I can just take it easy and heal, but, it kind of scares me, that I can’t even imagine growing in my career. Everywhere I work, near me at least 5 men on the same level hungrily waiting for promotion and constantly working on it. They so confident, job is like their favourite hobby, a bit like it was for me before. 

And for me now - it’s like, no use in trying. My mind just constantly putting me in energy saving mode, “give up” mode. I half arse a lot of things, I’m hiding in absolutely tech unrelated hobbies. I’m not happy with that. Therapist don’t understand me either.

I shall introduce myself, I am a student in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Currently coursing the equivalent of 13th year in highschool.

In Catalonia, all students are required to do a research involving a subject of their liking during 13th and 14th grade. In our case, we have raised the issue of gender inequality, specifically in the field of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). 
We want to investigate why the percentage of women working in these areas is much lower than that of men, and the roots of this inequality. 

In the theoretical framework we have approached the subject and collected information from other sources to have an overview of the possible causes and consequences of the problem raised. And with that, we have to do our own research on the subject. This means that, in our case, through surveys or other means, we must find information that can verify or change our perspective on this issue. To this end, we have prepared a questionnaire (quite simple and short) with which we want to know the experiences of women who have worked or are currently working in this sector. 

Form link: https://forms.gle/RACQR8gXG8ReaNZKA 

If you match the intended demographic, we would be grateful if you could spend a minute or two answering the form.

And, even if you don't, you can still help! Feel free to share this form with women you know who are working in Information and Communication Technologies. 

Answers are completely anonymous and confidential, and will SOLELY be used with the purpose of academic research. 
Thanks in advance! It is greatly appreciated.

NOTE FOR THE COMMUNITY: We have decided to post in specialized subreddits like this one and r/xxstem because of our limited resources, we have no way of contacting a large number of adult women who work in this sector, so we come here in a dire situation to complete our research. As answers to our survey is the only thing we are missing.

I am reaching out because I currently feel very lost with where I am in my job. My ultimate goal and wish is to be a better software engineer and eventually grow to be a senior someday (I am 27 yo and about to finish my CS degree with a data science specialisation)

In total I have about 3 YOE, in my previous role I was a fullstack developer working with a Java Spring Boot/Angular tech stack in an agile environment and micro services and it was fun and dynamic but the culture was horrible and eventually burnt me out.

Now I am working in the IT department of a finance related company that used to be very small and recently grew since ~1,5 years but in the IT department the processes haven't really adapted yet. Legacy code base with huge theoretical complexity (Java, Spring, Maven, JavaFX) and a web application that is built in Angular (15-17) built by an external service provider with 5-6 developers from that company that have made software for us for the past 15 years. Me and another colleague were hired so they have internal 'back-up' but the communication is difficult, we don't have any project management basically, very waterfall based, barely any structured work, deadlines or planning. We feel lost about the fact that we were hired to help develop software but the circumstances don't help us grow or be better developers. In fact I feel like I am unlearning everything I learnt at uni because I cannot utilize it in the current architecture that is very customized from the general state of the art approaches I've usually been familiar with. 

We hardly get any support or feedback and it just sucks. Everytime we ask for structural changes and support we have to solve the issues ourselves. We are severly undermanaged and it's really taking a toll on my mental health, work ethic and confidence. I feel kind of depressed to be honest. Everytime I get a spark of hope and optimism and suggest new ideas or ask for more projects or new projects where I can play around and not struggle with the spaghetti codebase, it gets crushed.

I love my coworkers and feel comfortable on a personal level. The pay is good and the job is very safe/stable so I feel so guilty and bad about feeling so lost work wise. I really don't know what to do, I am scared to give up the stability this job gives me but I feel like I am capable of more. I feel very safe here but at the same time I feel like I am wasting away the best years of my career by stagnating in a dysfunctional company. What do I do?



TL;DR: severly undermanaged and not seeing any possibility to grow and use my skills in current job and feeling guilty about giving up a positive work environment/culture",user_569,16,11

Hi everyone!

I graduated with my BS in CS back in May 2024, and have yet to land a full time software developer job. I’m entirely lost. I’ve revamped my resume, I took on an IT Technician role part time, and working as a web developer for a pretty large non-profit featured by Forbes. I've applied to 800+ jobs at this point.

I have internship experience and even a part time front end developer job during college. I made a cool React project over the summer that featured my art skills combined with coffee recipes, and am working on my Net+ right now to add more to my resume. I made a portfolio website as well.

But no matter what I’m doing, I’ve yet to get a job. I came close a few times, but the companies lost the budget for the role or went into a hiring freeze.

I feel so lost and honestly like a failure. I’ve had my friends try and give me referrals to big companies like Amazon but I’m just getting ghosted, not even so much as a rejection email. I get ignored by recruiters and even when I get a referral, nothing comes from it.

I’ve been applying to in person jobs in my home city and a major metropolis area, as well as remote. I truly don’t care about salary, so I’m not even chasing after prestigious jobs. But everyday I go on LinkedIn and see someone from my uni class with less on their resume that got a high paying software job, while I’m not even able to get a callback to companies paying 25/hr.

What should I do? Is there anything else I can do to beef up my resume? As I mentioned, right now I’m working at the help desk and my company is good on promoting up, but I wanted a software development job, and they don’t seem to be hiring for those. I’ve even spoken to the COO of my company and they said there’s nothing open.

I’m really trying not to be discouraged but I’m at a real loss here. I’m a U.S. citizen, but my name and picture is clearly foreign, so maybe that’s another factor? I’m not sure.

Any advice? Thanks everyone! I’m also happy to share my anon resume here as well.

He's not even obese i wouldn't even say but he has what you can say is an extreme pot belly. It sticks out in a big way that you can't ignore it. Perfectly round and hard like a preggo. Their words not mine. I can see why it's easy to pick on. I've had a lot of these jobs. People get by on bad jokes and treating each other like shit in the trades so I get that.

But this guy is having like such a bad time. There are too many insults to go into so I will just say the one that took him down and made me get upset. Yesterday one of the pricks was behind him in line at the fry truck and like actually rubbed his belly. He poked him a few times with his finger and was saying is it gonna be a boy or girl? And other stupid crap. I was right in front of the poor guy and could see he was trying not to cry. This guy is in his 40s. It's too sad. I almost started crying myself.

And I have like no idea what to do about it. There is no way I'm going to complain. The whole place is guys all the way up the totem pole. Nothing will come out of that trust me. I called my brother and he says I should prank him hard with some of the other employees. Not everyone likes the mean guy he's a freaking doosh.

If you’re still interested in getting a personalized career pivot plan or CareerNav Snapshot (either now or in a future round), filling this out will help me prioritize and circle back when I open up more spots.

—————————————————————



Hi everyone!

I’ve been seeing a lot of career questions in our community lately - especially with all the layoffs, AI shifts, and just the general uncertainty around “what now/next?” It’s been on my heart to give back a little.

I started out as a software engineer but realized I wanted more human-centered work, so I pivoted into analytics, then AI, and now product management in both areas. Since then, I’ve helped 13 folks make career transitions - including people impacted by layoffs - and even helped my husband move from petroleum engineering to data science.

Now I’m building CareerNav, a tool that helps folks find career paths they’re already well-aligned for, identify transferable strengths, and close small skill gaps to pivot confidently. While I’m still in the testing phase, I’d love to offer 3–5 free, personalized career pivot plans to folks in our community.

All I need is some career info you feel comfortable sharing and here’s what I’ll send you (for free):
 1. A career direction that fits your strengths and background
2. Your top transferable skills
3. Any skill gaps and how to close them (with free/affordable options)
——————————————————————————

Why you might want this:
- You’re feeling stuck or unsure what’s next
- You want to switch industries/roles without starting from scratch
- You’re burned out and want a reset, not just a new job
- You’re ready for a real plan not more internet advice
- You’ve tried random courses but still feel lost
——————————————————————————

If any of this resonates, drop a comment or DM me with:
- A quick intro about yourself and what you’re hoping to get from this experience
- The role(s) you’re interested in exploring or transitioning to
- Your resume or LinkedIn (optional - you can remove personal info if you’d like; I’m mainly looking at your experience/skills)

I’m looking to take on 3-5 people for now with varying backgrounds, so I can really test how flexible CareerNav is across different paths. Would love to help if you’re in that “what’s next?” stage.

I am transitioning my career to executive roles and I want to share a revelation that I've had through coaching and networking with this experience: **Get more comfortable bragging about what you've done.** 

For the last 15 years, I've focused on doing--I was just chasing big data and interesting problems to delight customers. I don't have a CS degree but I've worked hard/smart and been successful. Not having a CS degree always made me feel inferior so I would work harder, bigger, innovate more. I felt alone in my space but when you're alone, you don't know if it's because you're behind everyone or ...if it's because you're out in front. I always just assumed I was behind everyone since I didn't see my early career peers in the same spaces I am in now.   
  
This process has made me realize that in my case, I was alone because I was out in front of the technical innovation. But...I never talked about it until NOW as I'm trying to 'sell' myself to company leaders to hire me to run their Product/Eng orgs. 

**So let's give it a try. Let's practice bragging. Tell me some dope ass shit you've done.** 

I joined a startup when it was valued at $100M and built out a full suite of analytics products into the product and increased the valuation to $550M when we got acquired--in less than 2yrs. These products also had the fastest data performance on the market and the largest implementation of its kind in the world--oh yeah with an 88% (!!) customer penetration MoM. I won industry awards for technical innovation all while promoting my team members and keeping attrition low while we cranked out this incredible product set.

I work on a large, strategic alliance at my company. I’ve been on the account two years now. I’ve noticed my product teams will continually come to me and ask me to get a forecast from my partner on xyz product of theirs so they can gauge market readiness on our side downstream before launch. 

To me, this feels kinda cringy? The thought of going to the VP of Global Sales at my partner account and asking them how much they’re forecasting in pipeline so we can gauge an estimate for revenue on this one specific hardware product, I fear makes us look disorganized, like we’re lacking confidence, and uncertain. 

I would think rather than going to an alliance partner, you’d be talking with the internal sales teams and maybe focusing on pilots with a few large customers or channel partners? I have no idea and just want to get a gauge on the typical process, because the asks I’m getting feel out of place.

Can someone give me a broad overview of the steps taken to assess market readiness before product launch?

Apologies for long post, in an emotional state. 

I have now been out of that job as long as I worked my first job out of college. 6 months. Just now am I starting to realize that some of the things that were said to me maybe weren’t “normal office culture” and I kind of just want to be reassured by other women who know more than me. 

I interned there on the same team, backend support. It was a really flashy, new business in my city and I was really proud to have gotten a job there. I was the only woman on my team but that didn’t bother me. The next youngest person was another former intern from 5-ish years ago, and then everyone else was 10+ years my senior. On the first day of my internship when I went to meet my manager, a 32 year old guy with a wife and kids, one of the first things he asked me was if I had a boyfriend. It was kind of an awkward question and I was very nervous but I told him I was engaged and we moved on. It seemed like he didn’t really move on, maybe I am reading into this too much but he always brought up my fiance. I didn’t really think much about it at the time, and even now I don’t know if it is particularly weird, but I find it important to note. 

I turned 21 while I was an intern and my manager said we should all go out for my birthday and he would pay and I can get totally drunk. Declined the invite, not my speed, but I think it is a weird thing to say to your intern. Also offered to buy me a bottle of wine as a birthday gift and asked me what wine I liked. He never did actually buy me anything thankfully. 

When I came back to work full time the next summer, one instance I remember being particularly egregious is we were sat beside each other in a meeting. I always wore my badge on my first belt loop. While I wasn’t paying attention, he grabbed my badge reel, pulled it back, and snapped it back against my thigh. I reacted, but we were in a meeting so there wasn’t much I could do. I am thinking about it now and this man, my manager, had to reach into my personal space, practically place his hand onto my thigh to grab my badge and then snapped it like a middle schooler snapping bras. He would not do this to the men on our team and snicker afterwards. I was being treating differently. 

A week before I was laid off, I was in a 1:1 alone in a room with him. I was talking about how nervous I was about the rumors floating around and how I might lose my job (haha) and he said something along the lines of “you need to do something about that” and in a moment of not thinking before I speak, I let slip that I had just started medication for anxiety. This set him into talking about how taking this same medication had killed his wife’s sex drive and they had a dead bedroom, asked if my fiancé was okay with me taking this medication, spoke more about him and his wife’s sex life, etc. This went on for the remaining 10 minutes of our 1:1. Yes, I knew this was weird. But I was so naive and I am so young and new to this I thought this was how offices worked. I thought this is how managers talk to their employees and this is just adulthood. I am realizing now that maybe he was just wanting to open the doors for a conversation about sex with me. 

I got laid off the next week, I don’t know how high or low the decisions were made or if he had anything to do with it. I got a new job in the city he lives in and innocently asked if one day, he would be interested in meeting for coffee or lunch. I received this message in response:
“Hey, I appreciate the invite. Unfortunately, I think 1:1 lunch wouldn't be something that I'd be comfortable doing since our relationship isn't professional any longer. This isn't anything against you nor is it suggestive. I would, however, be open to setting up a zoom meeting or something every few months for career mentorship if you're interested. Thoughts?”

For awhile I was really confused by this message. Our relationship wasn’t professional any longer? Why not? I intended to talk about getting back into software engineering and career things. Not personal stuff or having any interest in being buddies. I thought he was trying to be extremely above board. But he never messaged me back to do any career mentorship. And I started thinking, he was never above board when I was his employee. All the strange things he said to me and did to me, he never would have done to any of the men I worked with. I was being treated differently, treated sexually almost which is disgusting me so much I feel ill. I started to realize this because at my workplace now, none of this would happen. I have a male manager who is about the same age and he would never put his hands near me, speak anything about sex to me, or offer to get me wasted. 

I feel very ashamed and embarrassed for being in this situation even though I didn’t do anything. I just really would appreciate some guidance and advice from women who have maybe been here before, I am far too inexperienced to know what is truly the case here. Or maybe I am reading into this too much. I just don’t know if there is anything to do, or if I just keep this to myself and see it as a lesson learned. Thank you so much for reading all of this

I'm a woman in my early 30s working in tech, and something happened recently that's been bothering me. I was at a company sponsored event where there was drinking involved, and the CEO pulled me aside and made a comment about me being ""hot."" It caught me really off guard—especially because all night he had been looking at me in a way that felt... off.

To make it more frustrating, several senior male coworkers also spent more time talking to me about my appearance than anything work-related. I felt like no one was seeing me for the work I do—just how I looked in a dress.

People often remark that being a tall woman means I automatically command respect, but in situations like this, I feel reduced to a stereotype or an object rather than a peer or professional. I thought that being in a senior position would also make a difference, but it seems like in some ways, things are as they always have been

I didn’t know how to respond in the moment. I got flustered and laughed it off, but now I’m left wondering if I should’ve said something—or if I *should* say something now.

I think it is genuinely best to build up a relationship over time and learn to give this feedback once there is mutual respect but sometimes you never seem to get this opportunity or they treat you poorly from the very first day they meet you. Then what do you do? Are women actually valued or wanted in tech, aside from being a checkbox? Do good teams actually exist? Please tell me your experiences either way. In my opinion, the more you give them negative feedback, the more insecure they become. Maybe it's about giving them that feedback as gently as possible?

I am currently the breadwinner for my family after my husband lost his tech job last summer.  My current job is *fine*--it pays well and I love my manager, but for a lot of reasons I’ve been submitting applications in my niche field whenever a good opportunity comes up. Like most folks searching for tech jobs, I’ve been met with mostly crickets.

I finally got a bite via referral to my husband’s previous company, with his blessing because he’s been very adamant he loved everything about the company (he still talks to former colleagues) except for his skip who played literal mind games with him for over a year until she (via his extremely inexperienced manager) finally said “PIP or leave.” I watched him become a ball of stress and anxiety for the year she batted him around and micromanaged down to every comma in his Slack messages. He chose to leave because there was zero hope of them not firing him at the end of the PIP. His performance reviews were always glowing, but he was the highest paid in his role so the only thing we or his former colleagues can surmise is that his skip personally disliked him for whatever personal reasons and wanted someone cheaper.

I was holding out hope the role I applied to would be under someone else. But nope! It’s his old skip. I’m not touching that with a 100ft pole and am so incredibly frustrated. FINALLY a bite for a good role at a good company in my salary range and I'd be reporting to the person responsible for over two years worth of our familiy's stress and anxiety.

Today, I just want to burn it all down and become a bog witch.",user_1044,74,32

Maybe it means letting that one guy teach you something you already knew. Because the times when you did give feedback to people privately, directly, with thoughtful wording almost always get used against you. 

Is there actually a way to do it if you didn't grow up wealthy and well-connected? Dignity, to me, is about having optionality that lets you easily walk away. You either have piles of money to let you build yourself up authentically, or you have to people please or live a lie.

The pressure to be honest in a world that judges failure and punishes people who call out right and wrong is confusing to me. When you see people blatantly get away with doing wrongdoing, it's like the understandable white lies we do for survival instead of what others do in the pursuit of greed are no longer forgivable. I don't understand it.

You're expected to be honest and a champion of justice and someone who does what's responsible and right if you're poor and vulnerable, but you're also forgiven for lying if you're wealthy and well-connected. Am I wrong?",user_49,36,13

I do have my own interestes & projects i want to pursue. Currently, onto building my own startup.

Often, i come across that so much info out there tailored wildly for men. Reason why i think this is : men can easily compartmentalise their feelings & manage emotions (although they could be dying inside).  
I've tried collaborating with women of my field & have met some women who've mentored me so well.  
But when it comes to making it big in startup world, it's ssuper male dominated & most of the guys i meet to collaborate or a founder's event/party/dinner, seem to either ignore the fact im present or talk only if they think i might favor them sexually or usual sideline as i don't come from prestigious school (but i ddo have a super well paying job).  
I tried being calm & composed abbout it or speaking it out on the face aas well, however, it seems I'm always falling behind in this.

Once an ex-mentor, who was somewhat senior in AI field told me - ""as a woman, find a rich man, who's easy going & live easy life, pursue your side quests. When it comes to startup world, they might consider your urgency to make things work as PMSing/want to get married/aging/other factors while making investments."" (somewhat on similar lines she said)  
That kind of hit me cuz how shitty it was (also why's she now my ex-mentor), but i'm still going on with my stuff. If i work with urgency, i'm viewed as hectic, but a man working with urgency is called focuse in this startup world.

Question- I'm feeling so lost on what are  my duties & goals as a woman? I usually look up to many women founders but lately, really admiring princess diana. However, the thing with her is she lost family, husband kids. That was just an example, all i want is to feel whole as a woman!",user_1134,25,5

I love my work but the situation in my team has gotten from bad to worse to completely unbearable. As a woman I have to try 10x as hard as the men around me, and I do that without hesitation. But what stings is men doing none of the work and getting ahead just in the basis of storytelling and brown nosing. I have an extremely unsupportive manager whose #1 priority is to be in the good books of engineering and product leaders to get ahead himself. More recently a project I’ve outed my heart and soul in for  years that is going live soon (and that everyone knows is going to get big) is likely to be taken away from me under the guise of “re-orgs”. As a “temporary resolution” he has forced me to take up another team which has a dozen projects going on and that all need my intense involvement. 

I’m burnt out, unhappy, and resentful. I feel completely alone in a sea of men who don’t seem to have any ounce of emotional intelligence. My love for this field has been completely overshadowed by the hate for this team and this company. 

I’ve been thinking of taking a sabbatical but that would mean quitting and having to move back to my home country, which is invoking its own grief. I worked really hard to get here and now to have to give up all the glory, it feels like failure. But I also know that if I continue I won’t be happy.

I thought I was finally close but dodged a bullet by the looks of it. 

I'm questioning whether this is possible anymore? I read the news (to understand layoffs, AI etc.), reddit and also learning through my own experiences that it is very tough and I usually get ignored or told there's no roles when reaching out to companies. Is it worth it? I'm conscious about how long I've been trying and feel quite miserable as I'm not moving forward, I do like to learn but not interested if it's not going anywhere. I'd rather spend the time moving to something related to my experience and degree and try something else that has potential than keep trying but I'm on the fence, the negative experience has definitely made me reconsider.

One of the biggest concerns is the layoffs, uncertainty, and the constant learning. I've been learning skills outside of my full time job and it definitely feels like I haven't had much of a life - which hurts more now as it's getting more difficult and I don't want to waste so much more of my time being in the same position.",user_1136,0,3

Some people argue that DEI is bad because they believe individuals are hired based on gender rather than competence. On the other hand, in male-dominated fields, I’ve witnessed something similar men being hired and presumed knowledgeable simply because they are men. In reality, I’ve noticed that some of these men are less competent than they present themselves to be.  

First example, I read a book by a male author that had great reviews, but the writing was terrible. The book was tedious and difficult to read, with poorly explained concepts. Instead of simplifying ideas for the reader, the author seemed more interested in bragging about his knowledge. The book lacked empathy for the reader and felt more like a showcase of the author’s ego.

I’m in need of some advice from you smart people. I’m a 30-year-old hardworking, creative, and very dedicated project manager based in NYC. After a year and a half of applying to jobs nonstop with 0 offers, I quit my job two weeks ago as I could no longer stand my boss. 

I really love project management, but I’ve only worked for crappy unappreciative companies. I’ve worked so hard to change things and have gotten nowhere in today’s market. I quit my job think things through and figure out why I’m not getting where I want to be professionally and how I can change that, and I’ve come to the conclusion that it might be time to level up my skills and credentials to stand out more. I am very seriously considering a masters in Data Science or AI.

Programs I’m considering:
- Georgia Tech online MS in Analytics
- UT Austin online masters in Data Science
- UT Austin online masters in AI

After reflection, I realized that I wish I had a more technical background. I considered an MBA, but I’m not certain the roles out there excite me. What does excite me are technical PM roles. In every PM role I’ve had, I’ve done a lot of data analysis—but it’s always been very manual (think Excel and gut instinct), and I’ve been interested in the ability to work with more complex data and programs to accomplish the same thing. I want to be more efficient in the work I’ve already done, and potentially broaden my opportunities to work for better companies.

Here’s my background:
- Nearly 7 years of project management experience
- Most recently spent 2 years at an IT infrastructure / security hardware company (just left 2 weeks ago)
- Before that, ~2 years in real estate PM, mostly on IT infrastructure and construction projects
- Started in interior design PM (~2.5 years), but realized I liked the project management side more than the design itself

Does data science or AI seem like a good move here? 
Any insights on the differences between the two?
Any insights on potential ROI in today’s world?

I have about four year of experience in DevOps Engineering and two in Data Engineering. My most recent role was in DevRel for a DevOps Startup which I was laid off from. My role prior to that was as a DevOps Engineer and I was laid off from that too. It definitely took a knock on my confidence and I have never had a Senior role before.

A recruiter reached out to me to put me forward for a role as a Senior Platform Engineer and at the time, I thought ""Why not? It's a great opportunity"". The thing is, I've never had a Senior role before and I don't think I can do it. The interview requires that I draw up a solution I worked on where I took responsibility for design, create an architecture diagram and present it during the interview. I've never done any of these.

I'm wondering If I should withdraw my application. Maybe I'm not cut out for this interview? And even if I did well in the interview, what if I fail in the role?

Any advice on what I can do to prepare in the short amount of time or whether I should just withdraw my application. I'm not sure what to do and I'm freaking out.

Thank you.

\*\*UPDATE\*\* : 

Firstly, thank you all for the words of encouragement and thank you all for the advice. I didn't cancel the interview and I went ahead with it so thank you all for encouraging me. 

The interview went better than I expected BUT I didn't do well in explaining technical processes such as CI/CD. I'm dyslexic and AuDHD so I really struggle to explain things even though I understand them. It helped me highlight an area I need to work on. 

All of your advice as well as the interview gave me the confidence to tell myself that I need to fill in the technical gaps so I can apply for Senior DevOps/Platform Engineer roles. I updated my LinkedIn headline as well so those opportunities can find me too. 

I don't know if I got the job. Regardless of the result, I'm really proud of myself for seeing it through. Thank you all so much! <3 ",user_1145,11,19

After I posted this, it got better with my boss ""Bob"". He was more respectful, but still overall wasn't a good leader or supportive.

This past week, we had our usual weekly meeting with me, Bob, my junior teammate (who reports to Bob), Bob's boss and Bob's boss's boss. But everyone was coming hard for me and my junior teammate after we had to defend ourselves after following their previous direction and as usual, Bob did nothing to help.

The next morning, I reached out to everyone asking if there was something we could do to ensure we were aligning on the correct information. Bob responded and accused me of shifting responsibility. I responded wasn't trying to do that, but that junior teammate and I need a layer of that leadership guidance since our bandwidth is tight right now.

He immediately blew up in the chat, and then insulted my junior teammate and me, and while giving no feedback on what to do moving forward. Junior teammate and I were shocked and like, ""did that really happen?"". After almost 24 hours, no one responded to Bob's message or reached out to junior teammate or me, so we privately messaged Bob's boss and Bob's boss's boss. Bob's boss responded that he was traveling but acknowledged he saw both the exchange and this message.

Later that day, I saw that Bob and Bob's boss's boss were on a huddle for at least 10-15 minutes. Right afterwards Bob asked if we could huddle. No apology - he instead tried to act concern as to how I was feeling...then when I re-read his insult, he was just like, ""things got heated.""

That was literally minutes before we were all having another meeting (which was scheduled before all this happened). Bob's boss couldn't make it, but Bob's boss's boss was there, and immediately addressed all of us and said how things seemed to have gotten a little heated the day before, but he did want to address that junior teammate and I are both meeting expectations and there haven't been any previous discussions regarding our performance, which is one of the things Bob had accused/insulted us with. Bob didn't speak up at all.

So obviously this is extremely stressful, but at least Bob's boss's boss sees what's going on, even if Bob's boss has his head in the sand for the most part.

I know next week Bob is still going to try to shift this to ""feelings"", like what was going on with me and that he felt like I attacked him, which I had told him it was not my intention to attack.

Here's also another layer. So no one had responded to his insulting message, or reached out to me or junior teammate that day. At the end of that day Bob had posted a picture from the offsite where his boss was at, along with the other team managers. The picture he posted was them all on scooters (his boss included) with the caption, ""need a name for our scooter gang!!"". Here's where it gets interesting....big boss (Bob's boss's boss) is very active on that channel and always either adds a comment or emoji to posts. But this post? He added nothing.

\----------------------  
Original post:

*I've been at my current company 1.5 years as a ""Sr. Tech Specialist"". My new manager, ""Bob"" started 3 weeks ago and I can tell he's going to be a nightmare to work with. Instead of learning our products, processes and the WHY, he's trying to exert his authority by giving orders and trying to answer questions, but with both, he's demonstrating a deep lack of understanding in our company and the role in general. When he acts like that, it just makes it more obvious he doesn't know what he's doing. On top of that, he's so patronizing, and talks to me like I started in the working force yesterday.*

*Bob's director (""Larry"") is still involved in our team for now, however Larry is sexist and pretty clueless in general. Our last manager was wonderful, but I think he couldn't deal with Larry and upper management, so he left. I think Larry hired Bob because he was the first* *~~man~~* *person to apply. I've worked with Larry closely over the past 1.5 years, so I think this scenario is most likely. Even if Larry sees Bob not doing a good job, he won't say anything because he's conflict avoidant and won't want to admit he made a bad hire.*

*I'm trying to find a new job, but the market is tough so I want to protect this job as long as possible. So how do I respond when Bob tries to mansplain to me about something I already know or give career advice? In a perfect world I'd answer any questions he had about my past accomplishments at this company, or explain that our previous manager made that decision, but he's the type to see that as challenging his authority.*",user_427,55,14

What are some DOs and Donts when it comes to interacting with teammates as a woman in tech? How do you establish respect and professionalism early on without having to constantly ""prove"" yourself? Any tips on handling subtle biases or building strong working relationships would be incredibly helpful!

tldr - Any tips for dealing with frequent, lengthy interruptions, especially by more senior devs, when trying to get your work done?

Past careers where I was in-office didn't require as much brain work and were easy to switch on/off. Now, I really need to focus and have some quiet to do my work. We have an open-office, cubicle design. It wasn't awful early on, I kept to myself and could just throw on headphones if it got too noisy.

But since hiring a lot of new devs, it's gotten worse. When I'm not sitting in meetings, I have more junior devs coming up to answer random questions (that's fine, it's expected and I don't want their work blocked), QA turning to me when the devs on their team don't help or don't know how (again fine, let me try to unblock them), but also a new architect who joined and will come eat up 30+ min just talking. This week he came up to my desk when I was desperately trying to wrap up a ticket in the 20 min I had before I had to lead a meeting. I tried to explain I really needed to focus for the short time I had and have a feeling I come off rude and short with him out of frustration, and he still stood there talking to me about how anxious I was. I dread him walking up to my desk since he's frequently coming up at 4:55 and will talk for 30+ minutes, the entire time I'm thinking I need to get home to study for the class I'm in. There's been times where I go home and work another few hours to get actual work done.

The only suggestion from my boss (who's remote) was to block off time on my calendar for focus time. That does nothing when you're physically in-office. Even with headphones on, if people see I'm not actively sitting in a meeting/talking (or, if I'm in a huddle with a coworker and they deem it less important I guess?) they'll wait for me to take them off and acknowledge them, or like this guy, even wait next to my desk for me to finish when I say I'm talking with someone else. With some I am able to say ""hey let me just wrap up this thought, I'll get right over to help you."" It doesn't happen, it's like this guy wants me to turn my attention to him immediately and happily.

Sorry for the vent. I feel like I'm falling behind in my work, getting increasingly anxious (especially anytime I see someone approach my desk), and more annoyed when our area of the office gets so loud I can hear it through the noise-cancelling headphones they issued.",user_877,35,22

It is also very strange and somewhat comical to have other companies reps immediately assume that they need to speak someone else about the technical specs of their products and services. ""If can have someone on the technical side reach out to us we can work with him on the details,""

It so weird because they are talking themselves right out of a sale, by immediately assuming that I am not serious or whatever.

Not like any of this is news but it is a bit jarring coming from a company where senior leadership is 75% women.

I understand that managers need to be manipulative to some extent but is this normal? Few things that he does: 
- Ignore or delay responses until it suits him, keeping me uncertain. Or responding when he needs something or if I am to be corrected.

- Withhold praise for a job well done. Actually as soon as I do well in something, without a pause I'm given some other target to chase without any acknowledgement of the effort. This has happened multiple times and i I no longer need validation externally but still, it's nice to be recognised.

- Subtly creating guilt when i keep a boundary like taking leave. 

- Making me feel replaceable - Earlier he has said that I can move to another team, i didn't do that as it wouldn't help me. 

- Subtly diminishes my wins- on sharing something unavoidable that the team had to suddenly pick up and that I achieved in a short frame of time, saying that it wasn't that important and not to spend lot of time on it.

- When i say that I'm streched for time, I have to jump through hoops to get that extra help. Like I need to do a POC of that project before getting more resources (this project is something which needs to be done, not optional )

- When i ask how to balance being a tech lead (managing a sub- team) and my individual responsibility, I'm told it's an opportunity for the next level. I'm responsible for projects in my sub-team like planning and testing, meeting deadlines, planning and estimating. But I also have my own projects where I need to get things done. I am currently at an IC role and have aspirations to be a manager, but that will happen only when I reach the next level of IC.
 
I'm also afraid of my perfomance review and promotion if i rebel or don't do as asked.

Sadly it's not all positive. I spent the last year battling with a bully at my job. I'd been there for over 7 years and I'm good at what I do. I had an incredible team that reported to me and we had an amazing dynamic going. Sadly, as is often the case, a mediocre dude showed up with exactly zero experience in my field and decided I clearly didn't know what I was doing and he could do it better. I tried my best to work with him, eventually sought help from leadership and HR, and in the end they decided to promote him and make me report to him. Two weeks later, magically my role was no longer needed at the company and I was let go. My old team was/is PISSED. But it is what it is.

I decided I'd go out with a bang, and prepared a data-driven presentation for my exit interview outlining how unsupportive of women the company has been. I genuinely believe they realized they messed up, but I'll never know for sure. I was able to negotiate a better severance offer out of it though.

I was relieved at not having to deal with that situation anymore, but also sad to lose my team and also pretty anxious about stepping into this cesspool of a job market. But literally the day after I was let go, I hadn't even updated my LinkedIn yet, I had a recruiter message me about a position I might be a good fit for. Two weeks and a couple interviews later, I have a new job starting on the 28th!

It was a lower position than what I had with a lower salary range, but they offered to increase both to better match my experience without me even asking and matched my requested salary.

Anyways, it's tough out there but there's hope if you're able to stick with it. I'm really excited about this next chapter of my career!",user_5,41,3

I’m one of only two women in a company of 10. The other woman’s been here 10+ years and has fully adapted the bro mindset—zero allyship 👎I’ve been here five. 

For the last two years, I’ve watched how every time I bring up actual issues—lack of team structure, zero communication, no leadership—I get punished. Tasks taken away, sidelined, ignored. Meanwhile, they celebrate the squirmiest guy in the room, even if he’s barely out of school and constantly screws up projects I have to fix. He has zero understanding of quality, strategy and planning. I have to do it all and teach him while he takes the credit at the end. And he’s now doing my job and thinking he’s good at it. He has no experience. 

When I point this out, I’m “too emotional.” Classic.

I’m not some fresh intern. I have a BA in Graphic Design & Visual Communication, multiple certifications (Yale, UC Davis), and 16 years in marketing, design, digital content, and psychology. But my expertise means nothing here. I’m also the lowest paid employee in the company. When I brought it up last year, they literally said, “How did you know?” Then gave me a 1500kr (€200) raise… spread over 3 months. Yay. The new salary I am on is the salary of what a candidate would start up at, at a new company with little experience. 

The place is chaos. Nobody communicates, there’s no leadership, and “teamwork” is a joke. When I tried collaborating, no one cared. When I stopped and mirrored their behavior, suddenly I’m the problem.

Company of less than 20. But we have 2 CEOs, 1 CTO, and 1 CFO. Ego parade.
One CEO is a little narcissistic & misogynistic who micromanages and does not listen to his employees, the other is a people-pleasing labrador who calls us a “family”, takes everyone’s emotions at heart and resists any change. I like him best but his light and his power has diminished in the last year and he was sort of the only one that kept it together somehow but not anymore. 

I’ve had two breakdowns in this place. I’ve been job-hunting for 1.5 years and it’s brutal in my area of expertise. I’ve contacted my Union to tell them about it and they just said talk to your boss which I did several times. I even have recordings, since it’s a one party consent state so I can protect myself. So what do I do?

I currently work for a FAANG company out of the US and I am considering moving to another FAANG (not Amazon). The new company is slightly more prestigious internationally, but in my country, my current employer has a zlarger market share and more/ larger customers.

Both companies have laid off employees in recent months.

I'll learn about the terms tomorrow, but based on my research, both the position and the salary will likely be comparable to what I have now. I could wait until tomorrow to post this, but in my experience, companies often give very little time to make a decision.

The advantages of my current job:

1. I enjoy my current role. It keeps me engaged. That said, I've enjoyed most of my previous roles as well—and I've had a few.
2. I like the tech stack and constantly learn new things (even though I can only do so in my unpaid overtime). The stack in the new company would be more limited, my current company is a bit more advanced in my area of specialization. I would also cover a much smaller technical area, maybe 50% of what I have now. I would need to learn a totally new stack, losing the specialization in a stack I've been specialized in for 7+ years.
3. It's still a great job overall. The vast majority of IT jobs in my country pay much less than what I'm earning.
4. I have managed to build an excellent reputation for myself at my company and with our clients. People like working with me and consider me an expert in my field, probably the biggest expert in my area at my company. I'm an introvert and consider that an important accomplishment.
5. Most colleagues are ok.

The ""but"" part:

6. I have an enormous workload, and it's impossible to change. Honestly, I'm doing the work of two full-time jobs. My boss pretends to support me in prioritizing tasks but unofficially pressures me to deliver even more. (Ironically, he was recently on a long sick leave due to burnout!). I'm in therapy and constantly hear I'm burned out and should take care of myself. I feel sick when I have to turn on my laptop on a Saturday again. And I have to most of the weekends.

7. Not everyone is held to the same standards of productivity, which frustrates me massively. I know people who only work three hours a day and brag about it. They maintain excellent relationships with their managers and somehow receive high performance evaluations.

8. I've been with the company for over 2 years, receiving excellent performance reviews and a promotion during that time. Yet, despite the promotion, my salary has effectively decreased! After months of working what boils down to two full-time jobs, I'm earning less due to minuscule raises. Talking about that with my boss makes no sense, I've tried.

9. No one cares about my career progression, even though my track record speaks for itself and I am vocal about my accomplishments too. I've won a few rewards, got a lot of ""verbal recognition"", which, however, had no financial consequences whatsoever.

10. I feel I have all the obligations but no rights. As the only female in a technical role, I definitely feel that. Some of my accomplishments are ascribed to my male colleagues, although everybody knows that I was the one to deliver.

11. If you asked me how my performance is assessed and what my role involves, I wouldn't been able to answer. It's so chaotic. And that's risky, because given that I have no formal goals, my boss can always argue that I haven't done something important if he wants to harm me. In the other company the team role seems to be much better defined.

12. I have a very good contact with my boss now. Because I decided to have it and worked on the relationship. After I joined he behaved like a total a\*hole towards me. I was totally shocked. So although he likes me now, I know that he is able to behave like an a\*hole and make your life hell without any fault of yours, which makes me uneasy.

I work in technical support. (24 F) We're a pretty small team but I feel slightly embarrassed because I feel like I put the most amount of effort into my calls but I don't get that many positive reviews. I'm just confused because they always end the call saying ""you've been super helpful"" or ""thank you so much for your help"" or ""you've been so patient."" However I feel like my coworkers who half ass their calls get more praise from people because they leave them a bunch of reviews. I know I shouldn't take it to heart because It's not like I'm getting an influx of bad reviews. I'll get one once in a while for something out of my control. It may be worth noting that I've been struggling with depression and anxiety really horribly the past few months and that's when my reviews have somewhat halted. I also seem to get harder calls or more difficult people routed to me (thinking this is just bad luck) as opposed to be coworkers who have simple few minute calls.

My boss has said nothing negative ever and even praises me and my work but I still can't shake the feeling that everyone hates me and I'm bad at my job. I was taking more tickets than everyone else as well and I think that was causing burnout. However I've scaled back on them and am starting to let others take more. I don't know if I'm just unlikeable or what... my tone is always positive. I'm quite introverted so I was not planning on keeping this job permanently but as as a stepping stone.

But I am having a lot of trouble getting my foot through the initial stages of the hiring process. Maybe it is because of the PhD, or that my background looks so strange. I am not sure. I feel pretty defeated, but I know I am capable and could be a good addition to a team somewhere. 

The people around me feel like I could land any job I wanted, but that is not the case at all.

Food and pastry in particular has been a lifelong passion of mine. My grandmother was a pastry chef so I grew up in the kitchen with her making croissants and tarts. I’m by no means a professional but would love to go through training and properly learn techniques. 

I’m fortunate enough to have been in tech for a decade and feel like I have plenty of savings built up at this point. But I’m just sitting at my desk and feeling so dejected by how disconnected I am from this job and just want to get out. 

Has anyone here successfully jumped to something in food, and if so what path did you take? Also how do you manage the potential money risk of not ‘making it’?

EDIT: 
Okay thank you so much to everyone who chimed in. I think both the pragmatic side and the more supportive folks helped across the board

If anyone’s curious I did some digging. Definitely going to start just on the side to de-risk, but I feel serious enough about it to go through the cottage food licensing process just to give myself optionality. Appreciate everyone sharing perspectives - doing this pre order / Hotplate thing from home seems interesting if I decide to actually keep up with it

And to the people who pointed out maybe it’s just time for me to do some soul searching regardless and get my mind right, you are correct lol.

I got promoted last year. I got the role that this guy Dave had. Dave got promoted too. He manages same product but for different clientele. Both our groups share same code base. We develop it first and then Dave’s team lifts and shifts for their group. My problem is because of this Dave pops in and out of design and high level meetings as he pleases. 

If he’s there, he acts like primary senior developer- talking all the time, when I try to talk he either tries to patronize me or says something like but we’re solutioning and we shouldn’t do that now and then go onto have a 15 minute discussion on the topic I brought up. 
I’ve had to say - I know that a few times , when he’s talking down to me. Recently I wanted a process change for my team that I own and execute. This guy drove me up the wall trying to challenge me, throwing distractions and not letting me get what I want. I had to discredit each of his claims one by one to get what I want. 

What makes it frustrating is that I know he’s a good guy but his insecurities or god complex is affecting my mental health. 
I’m happy just getting my money. But this constant mental circus of punch up if Dave is not in the meeting and punch down when Dave is there is not fair to me. He also did tech design on a couple of reqs and they all issues when business tests it and it comes to me for troubleshooting. But nobody realizes it was his design mistake that’s causing us time. So we have more stories to clean up trash. 
For all the above reasons, I told leadership of my team that I want clarity on what my role is.
So im meeting with 2 of the senior leaders in a couple of weeks to talk about it. I don’t know how I should present it to them. I can’t say it’s either him or me.

He comes back in a bit later and backtracks, now its not that serious and the projects don't have that tight a deadline, that he'll work with me on the process. Its just more gaslighting, I've done these contracts a hundred times and he knows it. He tells me to take a walk and get lunch somewhere, so i do. I walked two miles all the way to a cafe i like. I come back that afternoon and its like nothing happened.

It paid well, was remote, and I was decent at it… but I have never enjoyed marketing (kind of fell into it) and after mat leave, the culture got so toxic it started messing with my health, so I left. in this economy - which should tell you how bad it was. 

Now I’m taking a beat to figure out what I actually want to do next, and I’m kind of overwhelmed.

It’s not just that the job market is tough. It feels like everything’s changing. So many companies are shifting their entire business models because of AI. Whole departments are getting cut, especially in tech and marketing.

It feels like the only way to stay competitive is to either start my own business or become obsessed with AI tools that keep changing every five minutes. And I just… don’t want to do that right now. Not with a baby. If I didn’t have a kid, maybe I’d have the energy to dive into the hustle. But I’m tired.

So now I’m debating all these different paths:

- Marketing at a non-tech company
- Starting some “boring” business like a laundromat
- Freelancing
- Switching to something not as easily replaced by AI like program management
- Staying home full time (which I don’t actually want, but the thought crosses my mind on hard days)

I feel like I did everything “right” - got the big company experience, top MBA, leadership role at a startup - but it still feels like the road ahead is blurry. I want something fulfilling and flexible but not overwhelming. Something that lets me be present as a mom without feeling like I’m throwing my career away.

Anyone else been in this kind of spot before? What helped you figure it out? What would you do if you were me?

I've been mandated EAP by my leadership for unsubstantiated and seriously detrimental claims that could jeopardize my future. Without giving too much away, I work a security clearance job with fitness for Duty requirements. 

The short version is I had an altercation with a coworker where he yelled obscenities at me in front of other coworkers. It was investigated and magically nobody else witnessed it. I'm not sure what (if any) discipline was laid on his end, but I don't really care. What I do care about is I brought up other concerns after that incident. Obviously, this is frustrating because those concerns were largely ignored, excused, and glazed over. I consistently told my leadership that i avoid all interaction possible with this person and that I do not feel safe working with this individual. I had another coworker corroborate that I should never find myself alone in a room with this individual, and yet no action was taken. Of course, any time I brought up concerns i was largely ignored. My leadership literally said that they have never witnessed anything. I applied to other internal positions with very little luck trying to get myself out of a bad situation with little support.

Fast forward to recently when I requested a mental health day. The day I called out, my security clearance was pulled under allegations of abruptly leaving work, behavioral and health changes, and talking to people who were not present, all completely false and unsubstantiated. A part of my security clearance reinstatement was that my employer mandated EAP. 

Luckily, I found another position and turned in my resignation. I still have the option to continue with the EAP and security clearance reinstatement which I intend to complete to safeguard any future security clearance opportunities. 

My question is this, what would you have done in this situation? How could I have approached this differently? Do you think I should continue getting my security clearance reinstated even though I will no longer be employed there?

We launched, got paying users, and things started growing. But despite all that, I kept feeling like a fraud. I worried I’d done everything “wrong” because I didn’t follow the traditional path. The impostor syndrome was real.

So, I signed up for a CS fundamentals course—just to see what I was supposedly missing. It was all the usual stuff: data structures and algorithms. And to my surprise… I already understood most of it. Not from studying, but from building. I had just learned it in a different order.

That experience didn’t magically erase the self-doubt, but it helped me realize this: building a product that works and solves real problems is its own kind of education. It’s messy, but it’s legit.

My job is somewhat stressful because it’s performance driven and they cut 10-15% every 6 months. I’m competitive by nature and I get sucked into the rat race every other cycle, trying to get a promotion but I’ve been at the same level for about 3 years now. I’ve been looking for opportunities elsewhere on and off for the last 1.5 years but nothing has matched my current compensation ($160k). I do really like my current team a lot and enjoy the work we’re doing now.

I am getting married next month and we have both spontaneously started talking about kids and “happy accidents”. I initially thought kids at 35 at the earliest, but now that feels so far away. Baby fever has its grips on me. 

I took FMLA at this company 2 years ago for mental health reasons and came back to a bad performance review for that 6 month cycle as well as a coaching plan to improve my performance. It was wildly unnecessary and even my manager knew so, but the quotas mandated a sacrifice and I just so happened to fit the part. It did seem to really damage my reputation with upper management, as I’ve never been able to get back on track performance-ratings-wise compared to pre-medical leave times. I’ve definitely had a chip on my shoulder about it. And when it comes to family planning, it feels incredibly possible that I could return from maternity leave to a coaching plan or PIP. I’ve been putting applications in and even received a job offer last month but it was way less money ($110k) and more responsibilities. 

My questions are: How common is it for an engineer at my level to get pregnant? Should I expect to be discriminated against for being pregnant? Should I switch to project management or data analytics or something potentially less demanding than engineering? Should I switch companies?

My director already made a joke about me taking time off next month “to get married and have babies”. I just feel like there is a target on my back but it could also be selective attention due to the aforementioned chip.

I will say I am not in ""tech"", but I work for a tech company and my job is kinda a gray area of not HR, but not fully what y'all do.

I work remotely and love the work/life balance. My manager is making any work aspect of it though, absolutely miserable.

I've been in my role for 3 years and finally felt comfortable giving suggestions. Especially since our director asked us to this past fall. While in a one-on-one with my manager I showed him how I solved an issue in our product for our customers. His response, ""I don't want our customers to be able to complete our stuff that easily"". I asked why and left it at that. 

There were a few other times I suggested new ideas, nothing crazy at all and within our role/ability, and I was always told no with a 30-45 min ""lecture"" why it couldn't work. The lecturing is what really gets under my skin, he wants me to agree with him and I simply don't. I dont argue, but I don't agree and I think it drives him nuts. Needless to say, I stopped making suggestions.

When we did our annual reviews and he marked me down for being arguementive and not understanding basic procedures! When I asked for an explanation he said it was because I was questioning things and that shows I dont understand procedures. Yet, he also wrote in the review I am given high priority projects due to my ability to meet tight deadlines with little to no mistakes. 

At this point I'm terrified to speak. On top of that he still asks, ""do you agree?"" to things he implements and it is killing me to say yes. 

To add to it, a customer brought up a problem 8 moths ago with something I created. I identified that the wrong item was uploaded. My manager told me they would look into it since I don't have access to the customer part. Today I was emailed stating I needed to fix the issue that was brought up 8 months ago! I don't even know what to say, if I point out I already identified the issue then he might retaliate, yet it's not in me to bow down and say I did it wrong and fixed it. 

Seriously, how do I survive?

- Creating tools for specific use cases (example: providing an AI agent with 10 years' worth of past proposals, so when a new Request for Proposals comes out, the agent and I can write a new one faster)


I saw this course, which I think might get me at least part of the way to where I want to go, but I need more basics first: https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-genai-for-data-analysis


Background
I've spent the last 14 years doing something called Monitoring and Evaluation for foreign assistance programs. Basically I write surveys and analyze data for projects related to: an earthquake response, an ongoing war, to help farmers increase income, etc. I help program teams know what to do, if what they're doing is the right thing for the moment, and what the long(er) term impacts are of what they did. It involves identifying Key Performance Indicators and conducting analysis against those. We're often also knowledge managers. My superpower is that I'm really, really organized. 

I have a BS and MS in Applied Economics, so lots of calculus, linear algebra, and advanced stats - but I'm rusty. I'm also great at Excel (it's easy to hand off to people in lower GDP countries), and I used to be good at Stata (also rusty) and ODK (I think that's specific to our industry).

Our industry was just DOGE'd pretty hard so I've decided to take a step back and build up some skills while waiting to see how the dust settles. I'm hoping there is still a place for me in our industry but I also understand the realities of what is going on. I want whatever I learn to be useful in humanitarian settings but also transferable to other fields, as needed. 

I'm open to doing some math refreshers and learning some coding basics, but I don't want to be a coder.

the men that I work with are all awesome, and people I'd love to hang out with if we lived near each other. there was one instance where I was trying to deliver a project, and the normal method wasn't working. we usually just upload something and it works. so I posted my issue on slack. one of my male coworkers said something to the effect of, ""one sec, I'll try [unusual methods]. I promise I'm not just trying [usual method] like I know you have already done lol."" he clearly was aware that men tend to assume we're incapable. and he wanted me to know he believed me that something weird was going on, and he was trying to help me figure it out. instead of repeating the usual steps and assuming I didn't know what I was doing.

My interest in gender representation in Tech started when I started working in Cloud. After I challenged a manager to address the low female turnout at events, he asked me ""what are YOU going  to do about it?"". So I started interviewing women in the field on LinkedIn. 

These conversations revealed a surprising geographical divide: women in Eastern Europe (Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, Georgia) and India often perceive Tech as gender-balanced, with high female engineer ratios and supportive government programs. They frequently express surprise at the gender disparity encountered in Western Europe and the US.

This raises a concern for me, particularly living in the Benelux region: Are we adequately preparing the next generation of women for the AI era, or is this issue being overlooked locally?

To gather initial insights before diving into deeper research, I'd appreciate hearing your experiences. Could you share which country you live in, your path into Tech, and whether you feel there's a gender representation problem in your area?

I have been in ux for 14 years (lost my ux job in 2023 and haven't found a ft job since) and I'm wondering if the collapse of ux and tech can partially be attributed by the fact that so many DEI people are part of tech. It's the reason I initially got into this field,  because it's welcoming to diversity. It feels like everyone who is not a billionaire and not a white guy is under attack. I wonder if ux is under attack because it's big claim to fame has been empathy. I bring this up here because I know UX has attracted more women to this career, and because I think that's a big part of why UX is undervalued.

Of course,  ux is at fault for a lot of it's own problems, especially the fact that seasoned tech people keep blaming newer uxers for not doing any number of things (like regularly proving a business case for our activities or spending too much time on process). I actually have a very strong background in tying my work to metrics and spending as little time on process as possible, but I understand just because I am that way doesn't mean everyone is. I also know AI is to blame, even if we can't be replaced by AI in practical terms, leadership thinks we can be, so they're finding out right now, in real time. (and I hope, failing  but we'll see).

Ux is very collaborative so we have to work well with product/engineering/business/leadership in order to design a solution that takes everyone's needs into account. I don't think Executive Leadership values that ability, or sees it as a critical aspect of ux work - anyone can put together a wireframe, the real test is if *every*  stakeholder approves it. AI can generate a million wireframes or finished applications, but that doesn't mean anyone on the team will be happy with what they got because most people don't know how to translate what they need into a functioning visual design. That's actually what I spend my time and energy on, more than anything else! It's actually incredibly frustrating to do, and exhausting. There's more ways for software to go wrong than I think anyone outside of tech can imagine. 

At the end of the day, women are more likely to take on a collaborative, relationship-based role like the one I've described,  and thats a big part of why I think it's not valued or respected as work. Right now, the political climate is one where the ruling class doesn't value empathy, understanding or collaboration. They don't see value in prioritizing getting the opinions of people who use or buy their products to make them better. The climate is pro-fascist, and that means that a small group of rich people think they know everything and don't care about the repercussions of that. I feel like billionaires hate us even while they need us to consume their products. It doesn't make sense to me, because in the long term, who do they think will be buying their tech? I read an article by Joe Procopio where he said people who work in tech are the main consumers of tech products,  especially AI products. 

I really am trying to avoid seeing AI as a monolith, as all good or all bad, and while I acknowledge it's uses, I really think billionaires are quite silly to think they can keep asking us to spend money when we're out of work/out of money. ",user_1186,4,10

he told me they could evaluate how could i do this type of work instead. after this, i started to cry. i have never cried because of work before. i candidly told him about my frustration and that i didn't know how long i could last being in that place. at the end, he told they would try to find me a replacement soon. he seemed really shocked and taken back with my reaction.

i feel so embarrassed. this is my first big girl job and i feel so guilty for feeling like this. there are people unemployed that would love to be on my position. i feel like a created chaos and difficulty. i don't know how to navigate this.

to make things worse, i even decided to go ahead with a family trip in may. i was so sure i wasn’t gonna be there by then so i wasn’t worrried by pto but now i have to take that into consideration.

i feel like i majorly fucked up. if i knew there was any chance of me being moved to another position was a possibility i would have started there and talked to my manager first about my discontent with my current position. i think i did it all wrong, this is definitely a learning lesson.

You may have a great deal of work thrown at you, sometimes with very little guidance or direction. But, you’re expected to do it, so that’s what you do. 

Yet, when you end up doing the job well, when you have a voice and are able to speak to your work and explain it well, and even (gasp!) have opinions about it, you’re now seen as full of yourself, and potentially even a “poor listener”. 

So, you adjust your approach and become more subdued. You still take care of your work, but you back off in meetings and you keep a lot of your opinions and observations to yourself. You make sure to defer to others, as was requested of you, so you don’t come across as arrogant or incapable of hearing another person’s point of view. And now? You’re accused of being too quiet, too passive, and “not a good communicator”. 

So let’s get this straight. They expect you to fully own your job, yet when you do, you’re punished for that. When you then course correct, you’re punished for that, too. 

The utter hypocrisy is nothing short of nauseating.

I developed modules for onboarding 3-4 new system. All went well and I had high hopes for my career here. I had a very good lead.

I joined in 2021 October 

2022 December my manager left the company.
2023 mid year - my lead left the team
After that I took over his responsibilities and same was informed to the team.

Now I take care of 2 modules with 3 other developers who are of my same level. 

2024 Feb onwards I went on maternity leave.
In my absence, they had a proxy for me who was two levels up- she is same level as my previous lead.

I rejoined in September, I didn’t compromise on my quality of work. I still work late night and all the hard working nonsense.

In my absence my manager tried to get promotion for my male colleague. 

Now when I ask about it, I asked him “you had given me high hopes and promises since 2023 mid and you told me that you have got approval also from your manager, what has happened to all those” he is telling that you were not there when they asked to nominate. If you were there you would have got it, but you were not present. 

Now my manager called me and told that his got approved, I will try yours for next time.

In my performance review, my boss gave me a 3 out of 4 (exceeds expectations), told me he was putting me up for a promotion at compensation time, and had only glowing comments in my performance write up. 

Around this time, I asked for a significant increase in pay (18%)... My reasonings were that I was exceeding expectations, grew to double the responsibility I had a year ago, and my pay was not aligned with market comps in my state and role and this would get me there. 

My boss' response to this request was disappointing. He said that he didn't even make what I was asking for, and that with current company performance, as well as pay equity for all employees, he didn't think this was achievable, but said he would see what he could do.

At that time, I told him that I would rather defer any promotion until a later time, so that we could not lose that opportunity to give me a notable increase with the promotion. In response to this, he had a different point of view. He said that he would like to give me the promotion if approve because I deserve the title, and it will make me marketable externally even if it doesn't have a significant impact on my pay at this time. 

Fast forward to my compensation review. At this, my boss tells me that I have been promoted to the next level up, and then tells me that I am getting a 2% increase. This is not only less than what was given as guidance from HR for anyone who exceeded expectations (not considering promotion), but it is also less than the base level budgeted for people who are just meeting expectations. It also put my new pay still below the bottom of the range for the position I was just promoted into. 

While I am super pleased about the promotion, and the recognition it provides, I felt like the increase I received was not only disappointing, but confusing as it seems very inconsistent with the rest of my review. Outside of market and company performance challenges, no other context was given as to why I received this level of increase, and no other future plans relating to my pay were mentioned.

I am wondering if maybe I screwed up by asking for too big of an increase in the first place?

I'm trying to start out in IT. For a little context, I'm 28 and have been in hospitality for over 9 years trying to find my feet in this industry.

Last year I did my Google Cybersecurity and I quit my job in January to start making the change into IT. I've been given a lot of different perspectives and advices before. One advice was to just start looking, don't wait to study, another told me to go the Google Cybersecurity certificate route, which I did.

I've completed my CompTIA A+ certificate and working on my Network+ certificate. 

Recently I've been feeling very unmotivated as I got an interview with the CEO and it went fantastic! When I went into my second interview they both seemed so uninterested in me, I felt in the first five minutes that a decision has already been made, but in my head I was thinking I've already impressed the CEO I just need to make it work here. Got a rejection email a couple of days later.


I've also had a call with a MSP company who were looking at hiring level 2 and level 3 staff. He was honest and said that this is a massive stretch for even calling me as I don't have the experience they need. To keep it short he said I would struggle to find my feet before the probation period but gave me such solid advice. He also said I'm a female which is why they called me, and that's what the first CEO also said.

tl;dr

My colleagues are saying he had this feedback from the beginning, when starting working with me on ""the syndrome"". A the last day he came to other team standups and had said ""we were working with her for last 3 month but unfortunately we had to terminate her contract"". I really thought that impostor syndrome means that i am doing enough but not believing in myself.

The worst thing about it was hes idea that i have an impostor syndrome and he was that he was giving me exercises to ""believe in myself"": writing vision, writing stuff you are grateful for and so on, that were actually making you more distracted, when the real problem was delivery. I was ponting that i think i should focus on stories not this exercisses. He was saying ""its only points, not man-days"", moving my focus. Once he asked me why i am afraid to push to prod/stg, and i sad that i am afraid on destroying something or influencing other people work as we dont have data seed, so i need to think twice before doing that. He asked what worse can happened. ""i can be fired?"". He smiled and sad ""noone is thinking about firing you"". (it was 2 weeks before) When i was saying on my standup that i am leaving he almost cried.

On one hand it seems like it was not his decision, but he had all this official feedback from the begging and was not sharing it with me or even denying that there is some problem (or wa but i interpreted it wrong way)

Also is it so common to share at the end with other coworkers the details?

EDIT:

It was my manager idea that i have an impostor syndrome. Not mine

It started when i was told to make my career plan. I said that i want now to focus on delivery and making a certificate in one of the tools that we are using. He asked if i think there is an area to improve and my response was that i would like the story delivery to be more predictable and definitely work on improving where its possible. I think that working on plannings will help a lot

Hes response on nest 1on1 was that i am to harsh on myself and i probably have an impostor syndrome

EDIT:  
I talked with a person lvl higher. He said they were thinking that if i will believe in myself i will deliver more. If it was not problem with self esteem then they had to let me go

And the real shock: The boss said he saw problem eriel, he did not know what to do and he know its to late to fix it. He knows hes not the best menager

I am really pissed off they did not share feedback with me sooner. But also have super mixed feelings after he admitted that",user_1204,31,38

I've tried to in the past but I thought I was in the wrong place, maybe I still am. Before I start: I would like to mention that I will be talking about lower paid and lower educated jobs, as that’s how it’s called where I’m from, (actual sort of means practical).

So I hoped maybe you can help me out: I hear a lot about women in technical jobs and the difficulties of getting into leadership roles. But not so much about women working in technology in lower paid or 'lower' educated jobs, or even as a hobby. Where I'm from it's the reverse: I've read there are more women in 'higher' technical education than there are in 'lower' technical education and I think it resembles what I've seen in the workplace. That is, I haven’t seen female engineers where I worked but there were women leading people in technical settings. And it was not a guarantee for attracting women in technical roles at all, and I'm being nice here :s ..

At first I thought the mismatch of women in higher/lower technical roles had something to do with women not being strong enough to do the physical work that's done more in lower payed jobs, but I discovered this not to be black and white at all. I could say a lot about this but I'll try to keep my post short:

So here is what I suspect to be an often unadressed problem: I think the absence of women in technical roles in ‘lower’ educated jobs are one of the reasons, next to fear and mysoginy -cause those are real and quite often interrelated- that women in tech aren't been taken seriously as much as men.

It’s like you get some sort pyramid of hierarchy upside-down, which amongst others gives rise to all sort of nasty speculations. Also, I’ve tried to get other women to work in technical roles, but it’s been ‘prohibited’ in several ways. -I wanted to give some examples now but also, this text became long and way too detailed-

But anyway, I hope my thoughts on this are clear and I would like to hear -read- if you recognize this or not, or what your perspectives are on this matter. Maybe your experiences are way different than mine. I’m really curious and I’d loved to hear from you.",user_1207,18,23

It's expected that we have this deep knowledge as we progress especially if we wish to be senior engineers. This may mean creating opportunities for side projects to develop deep expertise.

Now that I’m back, I’m being told I need to restart the entire process because I was “away too long.” Like the impact I made before just… doesn’t count anymore.

It’s frustrating. It’s disheartening. And honestly, it has me questioning whether I even want to stay.
Is it too soon to consider leaving? What would it look like to resign just weeks after returning? Would it ruin my professional image—or would it be reclaiming my worth?

I am looking to do a security analyst role because I want to do something which would fit my skillset through the things I’ve learned through my degree programs and certifications. 

I interviewed with the IT and security teams from the company. They asked me some of the most basic and rudimentary questions to see if I knew certain terminology. They’re so basic that you can safely assume someone who got selected for a security analyst interview would know. The only other time I’ve been asked such things was from recruiters which is why I find it so surprising. 

For example, they asked me the difference between HTTP and HTTPS. Also the difference between hashing and encryption. Someone who has my degrees, experience and certifications should and would know these things. 

While there was some questions about my background and how  I would handle things, it still doesn’t seem right they would ask the most basic things. They can clearly see in my resume I would know the basics. I get that people lie, but people can lie on their resumes and still teach themselves how to answer interview questions without understanding them. So at that point how can you safely determine who’s lying and who’s not before someone is on the job? Just go on the internet, and google “common (insert job here) interview questions”.

yes, humiliated at tech conference , as a student. 

my college barely hosts tech fairs let alone conferences and I was able to go this one, with all the names and such. 

I saw one company that was interesting manufacturing and etc, massively popular. But no one was there but there’s was like 10 people standing so I just introduced myself and asked what were they looking for in a student  and probably stuttered, (just an aside my first fair as second year student by cred, but they don’t know that so it doesn’t really matter.) 

And the first remark one of the recruiters/employees  said “was those who are engaged and ask actually good questions.” and scoffed and i don’t know if i’m overreacting, but that humiliated me so badly. I already had printed out some resumes of mine but didn’t even hand them out. And even worse when i introduced myself as knowing stuff about the company, I was corrected as stating that the company doesn’t just do that, but while researching it stated exactly they were into mainly manufacturing and then pivoted… it felt as if i was already looked down up, and not sure if its because i’m a woman or “minority” or whatever.  Being first gen and low in come, I know i need to make the most of my resources, but it seems like im so out of the loop and especially with anxiety, and I know these are excuses, but im feeling like this is so overwhelming, more than the coursework or development. 

I was able to talk with a lady who was much nicer and told me how she ended up there and was planning to retire. I wasn’t able to remember her name but at least i knew that the she was already planning to head out, and at least she did say it was stable, and that she’s interested in gardening. And she kindly explain what they were pivoting towards, but she was also the only woman and at least more professional there. Thank God. 


I guess this is how life/fairs/conferences work, but i totally suck at them and it felt so humiliating, but I keep telling myself at least I went to gain something, even though I just wanted to curl up. 

i really like building stuff, solving problems and etc but i absolutely hate being humiliated as anyone does and am I the problem? (well at least in many parts because I clearly don’t communicate well.), but I don’t think it was entirely professional either. But everywhere you ‘ll get put down, so maybe i just need to move on and improve. But it’s kinda hard as someone who chronically overthinks. Should i have just shown my resume? Even though it’s kinda basic? … Wouldn’t that just be more humiliating?

I work in tech support on a team with both guys and girls. I’m a woman, and honestly, me and the other woman on the team carry most of the weight. The guys do work, it’s not like they do absolutely nothing—but they definitely don’t do as much as we do. If we didn’t pick up the slack, a lot of the tickets would just sit there untouched.

What really gets to me is that they get praised way more than we do. Like, it’s not even subtle. They’ll get shoutouts or compliments for doing the bare minimum, while we’re over here juggling way more and getting barely acknowledged. It’s exhausting.

At first, I liked our manager (she’s also a woman), but the more time goes on, the more I realize she just kind of lets it slide. It feels like no one’s holding them accountable, and no one really sees or cares how uneven the workload is. It’s starting to really wear on me.

I do expect from people with your degree, that you should be able to do it easily.“

It made me feel like my gender was their first impression of me and that my experience and qualifications were secondary. It felt like the other side of the coin of misogyny - I'm still seen first and foremost as a woman candidate, not just a candidate.

In my previous job, over a period of 2 years 12 people were hired to my department, only the 12th being a woman. I was the only woman on my team, and there were only 4 women in my department out of 40 people. Any time I would mention it to my team, it felt like anything the guys on my team would say would be wrong. It felt like they didn't have to actually care about it, they could acknowledge it and move on while I can't afford to not care, and I think hearing it from a male CTO made me feel something similar.

If he really wanted to, he was able to create an environment that allows women to succeed and that invites more women from the beginning, but the company already has 50 people in it and are only now trying to hire more women. None of the people who interviewed me were women. He doesn't actually have to care, he has already benefited from this system. It feels like doing women a favor, otherwise it doesn't need to be said. If you want to hire more women just hire more women, otherwise it gives me the impression that hiring more women is just another accomplishment for male managers.

All these feelings were made worse when it came time to negotiate my salary. I was offered much less than I think I'm able to get (12% less than what I asked for), and after really hyping me up during the interview process, the CTO really tried to put me down to accept the offer. He said stuff like how I don't actually have that much experience (almost 6 yoe), and that this offer is way more than the average salary for my qualifications (it's not) and he made me feel really shitty about myself. Mind you this was for a senior role. It left me feeling like an imposter or that I'm greedy and maybe I'm not as good as I think I am, when my bf who has less experience than me didn't think twice about asking for the same amount I asked for. I don't think that a man with my qualifications would get the same treatment and it left me feeling sour about this company saying that they're trying to hire more women when they put me down and played on my confidence, which is something that many women struggle with, especially in tech.

IDK, I think that there are companies out there that do make a genuine effort to hire more women, and maybe this company is too, but it felt really tone deaf to me. I can't imagine accepting any position after being put down by a manager like that, let alone after saying that they're trying to hire more women.

I feel so alone and unsafe.","Hi, everyone. I’m a 23yo woman and studying web app development. I returned to my degree this year after dropping out last year because I was sexually harassed, and no one really took it seriously.

But when I rejoined, I was the only woman in class, and last semester, in the first month of classes, a few male classmates added me to a group chat and sent porn gifs, one of them was bestiality. I was horrified. I reported it to the faculty director, who gave them a warning but also said she hoped it was just “a virus.” I didn’t feel safe in class after that.

Fast forward to now - we’re preparing for a coding competition in May, and I wanted to bond with the others so it wouldn’t be weird (please don’t victim blame, I now know I should’ve just tried to keep minimum contact). I asked if they were going out and joined them, trying to be friendly. But I recently found out there’s another group chat behind my back where they talk about me. They said they “lost respect” for me after I called out the porn, but that I’m “nice and cool” so they let it go. They also joked that I only asked them out because I wanted to be with one of them, completely misreading my intentions and sexualizing me again.

One of them has apparently been trying to get us to share a bed at the hostel, and the others have been encouraging it. He touches my stuff, plays with my hair, and makes me really uncomfortable. Someone else even called him out, but he just smirked. I don’t want to go on the trip with them anymore. I’ve decided I’ll stay somewhere on my own and only show up for the actual competition, but I’m not sure if that’s allowed so I’m looking for answers.

I’ve supported these same classmates to help us qualify for the trip - I created a PDF guide, helped them register, answered questions… I did all this just to make sure we had enough people to go. And somehow they still treat me like I’m not a real teammate, like I’m just there to be mocked or sexualized.

Today I spoke to a secretary at my university about what’s been happening, and she quietly told me it wasn’t safe for me to go on this trip. Then the president of my faculty happened to walk in. I didn’t want to say anything, I was scared - but she gently told me this needed to be reported. I told her everything. She promised to keep me anonymous and said she’d contact the university vice rector and the student ombudsman.

I told her I’ve already been through this once, and I’m terrified of going through it again. I told her I don’t want to report because the system failed me before. But she insisted this was serious, and that if it’s happening to me, it could be happening to other women too.

I’m scared this will go to the police without my knowledge, specially the spreading of bestiality content, and I’ll be retraumatized, after having been a victim of sexual abuse by a family member as a child and teen, and dealing with a broken system.

Right now I feel like I’m falling apart. I don’t feel safe in class. I want to cry and panic and disappear. I’m exhausted from being seen as a problem when all I want is to be safe, respected, and allowed to learn.

Thank you for reading this far. If anyone has advice, encouragement, or anything at all… I’d really appreciate it.

Edit: The trip was just canceled. I don’t have more info, but it was. I didn’t go to my morning class because I didn’t feel safe, but the teacher said he’s gonna support me and not fail me (this was my last possible absence before failing the class), and the director of the faculty as well. She wants to see me soon. At least the trip is off and one less thing to worry about, but we’ll see about the rest. Thank you so much for all the advice. I’ll be applying it as much as I can.",user_924,200,44

I told them I didn't want anything apart from ensuring I don't have to work directly with him moving forwards, and no more 1-1s. There must always be at least one other person in the room if we have to speak. 

They assured me I'm not in trouble so. Cool. 

The worst part is the company and I were discussing the possibiilty of me joining on a permanent basis. Now though, I'm not sure this is at all the right place for me to hang my hat. 
I updated my linkedin yesterday and had one interview. We'll see what comes next, and if I can get past this stupid drama that I never wanted to deal with.

Original Post:

Finally lodged a complaint with my boss on Friday about this dude who has been condescending af to me since the day I started…and who has also been kinda creepy. 

Note I’m a project manager and he’s an engineering manager (we both have inflated titles but these are the basic functions we fulfill).


Second note: BOTH he and I are POC. I’m going to state here now that I really really didn’t want trouble for either of us because under the current political climate, neither of us stands to benefit. Me probably even less but definitely him too. He’s also like, in his 50s? I’m maybe a few years younger than him but I happen to look much younger than my age even (this isn’t a flex - people treat me like I’m an idiot because they think I’m
a “young woman”).

ALSO: I’m on a contract. It’s a fairly lucrative contract but still just a contract. In this economy though - losing this job is very bad news.

The minor creepy stuff I was prepared to overlook because this kind of minor harassment happens so often with so many men, I can’t go around just being upset all the time or reporting every incident. I don’t have the energy.

Here’s the creepy stuff:

Dude openly checks me out and comments on my clothing and nails. He also sometimes touched my arm and shoulder and one time called me “baby”. For a while I speculated that maybe he was just enthusiastic about fashion (I’m giving him the benefit of a doubt). I even thought maybe he’s a gay man who is used to women treating him as a safe space. Literally I made up backstories for him in my head to justify why it wasn’t actually harassment….all while trying to avoid walking past his desk or interacting with him about anything non-work related.

The “gay” angle I mentally proposed had to get dropped when I found out he’s married to a woman. He could still be gay of course but you can be gay and a creep.

Here’s the not creepy but generally bs crap: 

Last Friday - day 5 of a go live gone absolutely wrong:

Dude basically told me to sit down and shut up because I was “distracting” the team by asking if we should get on a Working call to resolve an escalation. I was also asking if we ought to review test cases because we clearly missed something before we tried to go live. 

I told him it’s part of my job to try coordinating solutions and I am generally pressured by my managers to do so (in other words my managers expect me to do my job).

He went on to try to mansplain at me what agile scrum was (a model we don’t truly follow as is the case with most companies) and how to work with devs (my brother in Christ I have had a decade of experience in tech).

Anyway that was my breaking point and I submitted a summary of all of the above to my manager.

Note my manager is also a woman. She hadn’t seemed surprised, just resigned. Apparently she had provided the same feedback about him years ago.

Now HR wants to talk to me.

Given that he’s still around despite this pattern of behavior - I’m confident my feedback will go nowhere but I might lose my contract. My boss assures me I’m not in trouble and I need to not be afraid I’ll suffer repercussions but let’s be real here. We can’t make those sorts of promises. 

I fucking hate this kinda crap. I just wanted to do my job and go on home. I don’t like causing trouble. This all fucking sucks.

I live in a not-so-tech hub area, so finding a software developer internship where I can stay local was already hard. Somehow my charm and charisma (i guess) landed me an internship. I was ecstatic. 20 years old working overnights to pay for my CS degree and depressed, this was my way out. I didn't take the traditional route to college but still worked hard so I was so proud of myself

It was great at first. I threw myself into learning the stack, pushing hard for a return offer. The codebase was a mess and the business logic made no sense, but the dev team and my boss were nothing but amazing to me and I was learning so much. After 9 months of grinding, I finally got the offer... and then I saw the pay: $18 an hour.

I was stunned. Genuinely insulted. I made more scanning boxes in a warehouse overnight. This couldn’t be real. I told my boss that's a joke especially for no benefits and he fought to get me higher pay (he got me to $20 lol) and basically told me his boss is super cheap and would rather outsource than pay me more, but that he thinks I should at least take the offer to build experience and he encouraged me to look for better paying roles. 

To make things worse, they said they couldn’t bring me on full-time because they ""can’t afford to offer benefits."" Meanwhile, they brag nonstop about record sales and are offshoring senior roles to developers overseas, paying them the same, if not only slightly more than me. It felt like a slap in the face.

This was supposed to be my big break, but now I can’t even afford college. I’m earning less than $2,000 a month and asked to go full-time, only to be told I’d have to switch to sales to do that. Sales. I'm also the first female developer they’ve ever had, and yet I’m still fighting just to be taken seriously.

I’m at a crossroads. If I stay, I gain experience, build my resume but I can’t afford school, can’t move out, and I’m capped at 24 hours a week. I had to take a semester off and still can’t save. But if I leave, I go back to a warehouse job that crushed my wellbeing, even if it came with solid pay, great benefits, and tuition support.

**TLDR:  landed a dev internship in a non-tech area after hustling through school and warehouse night shifts. Loved the work, got a return offer, then found out it paid $18/hr, less than my warehouse job. No full-time option, no benefits, and a cheap CEO and they suggested I switch to sales if I wanted more hours. I'm the first female dev there, and now I can’t afford college or move out. Stuck between staying for experience or going back to a draining but financially stable job. Not sure what to do.**",user_1223,21,10

It’s okay to be negative.,"I wrote a “negative post” the other day. It was the first time I’ve ever written about my gripes and pain regarding my career as a software engineer.

I want to write something positive.  I have a lot of positive stories from the past 25 years of my career.

But I was reading a little book _Morbid Magic_, (yeah I’m one of those “woo-woo” weirdos) and came across a personal story I really wanted to post.

It’s a long story, and most isn’t terribly relevant to this forum.  But I think this bit is.  The story is from Kristoffer Hughes, a pathology technician (and a Druid but it’s a tech forum so I’ll skip that stuff ;))

“ _… taught me the power of “not coping”.  I hear these words so often in my work — “ I can’t cope!” — and now I afford the bereaved this retort: 

“Don’t cope, stop coping, this is not a time for coping.”  There is power in surrender, there is magic in not coping, for when one stops trying to cope, grief floods the heart and breaks it though the metamorphic power of love.

Honor your pain, your loss, and give it voice, and when you stop coping, do you know what will happen to you?  You will cope.  Grief is punctuated by question marks, but it need not be; it embodies so much of our humanity._”

I know what you might be thinking?

What the hell does any of this have to do with tech?

Well, the thing is, we live in a world full of platitudes like “don’t be negative” or “you have to love yourself first or no one will love you”.

But I think the only way to find real power is to let yourself have your own voice.

Don’t “cope” with toxic environments. Don’t mask for the sake of “negativity”.

I think it’s -very- important for the women in this forum to have a free voice.  Even if what brought them here is negative.

Because it’s only after allowing yourself to experience pain, and express that pain, that you can _actually_ heal.  Heal and see all the amazing, beautiful *other* things this life has to offer.

I once worked for 80-90 hours a week for a startup, over the course of four years.  The VCs folded and the whole company shut down, despite us finally winning some major contracts.

I took that stress and anger and stuffed it down as deeply as I could.  I didn’t complain. I took it all home with me.  I indirectly hurt people I love with my anger and lack of compassion (although fortunately I have good people in my life who still cared).  

I also burned out.

I now think it all happened because I never let myself have a voice.  I held myself in and said “I’m tough.  I can do this.  They won’t win.  I’m a survivor.” Etc

I actually wound up _emulating_ the same white knuckle type A jerks who can make tech un-fun.

And this SHOULD be fun.  It IS fun.  Tech is awesome.  It’s spaceships and laser beams.  It’s satellites and cures for cancer.  It’s clean water and future cars.

(Side note:  That’s the only good reason to want to be a vampire.  To see future cars.  Like is it gonna be Blade Runner flying around in the air?  Or magic magnetic slides like Tom Cruise in Minority Report https://youtu.be/iXpxnxAL62A?si=GBl47K7kA3o6HAov)

_Its okay to be negative_

That’s all Im saying.

Because it’s the only way you ever stop being in pain and start healing.

If any of that makes sense?

So I say gripe, complain, seek community, let yourself grieve.  Be negative if you want to be negative.

Because then we can all move on and have fun :)

Sorry for the long long rant post ;). Bit keyed up from late night cardio.

1jslhxo,2025-04-06 03:57:41 ,womenintech,https://www.reddit.com/r/womenintech/comments/1jslhxo/follow_up_peace_out_yall/,"Follow up: peace out, y’all ✌️","Hey fellow women and interested folks in tech — my previous post blew up, in kind of a good and a bad way… I own that the tone wasn’t perfect and I did not intent to minimize anyone’s negative experiences as a woman in this field. I have those too. That said, I’ve had dozens of messages from women asking for mentorship. I wish I had time to talk with every single one of you, but since I don’t, I put together the advice I give most often. This is the stuff I wish someone had told me and where I see a lot of early career women have pitfalls. And to all the women who told me to be the change I want to see, I’m taking that feedback on board and this post is my effort to share with the community.

Also, unrelated, but I would still love a place to shoot the WiT breeze. In case anyone is interested, I’m currently reading Careless People (amazing Streisand Effect there) and it’s great. Would love to hear what you’re all reading, tech-related or not!

Without further ado…

1. Yes, tech has its issues. But it’s still an amazing career and I would recommend it to my best friend.

There are assholes in every industry. You shouldn’t tolerate abuse — ever — but I still believe tech is worth pursuing. The flexibility, the earning potential, the upside literally cannot be beat. For what it’s worth, my sister-in-law is a biologist. She deals with just as much sexism but makes way less money. Tech is a solid choice.

2. It’s hard to break in. But it gets way easier once you’re in.

The first job is the hardest to get. Don’t let that discourage you. Once you have one role under your belt, doors will open.

3. There’s more than one way in:

	•	Crack the leetcode/technical interview formula (this can and should be learned - do not try to go in without preparing!!!)
	•	Get hired in another role and pivot internally
	•	Join an early-stage startup where they’re less rigid about requirements (this route has tradeoffs and risks but it can work)

4. Don’t waste money on courses and certs.

Please don’t drop a bunch of cash on bootcamps and certificates. Once you’re employed, your company should pay for those things. In fact, certs can be a red flag in some places, particularly west coast modern / young tech companies. The only real exception is something like a CISSP or niche credential that’s essential for the job — and even then, try to get reimbursed.

5. Focus on delivering outcomes, not polishing your personal development plan.

Growing your skills is important. But what your boss and leadership actually care about is whether you’re delivering results for the business. Learn to think about what success looks like for your team, and aim for that. (Eg your goals should not be like “learn this skill” but rather “deliver xyz thing that requires this skill)

6. Don’t do unpaid admin labor.

Don’t be the birthday party planner. Don’t take notes in meetings. Don’t schedule stuff for your (especially male) coworkers. This stuff will suck up your time and drag down how people perceive your role. And it will never get you promoted.

7. Have boundaries, but be cordial

Don’t assume everyone is out to get you, but also don’t assume they’re your besties. Be warm, be professional, and be careful what you put in writing. Don’t gossip. Don’t overshare. Assume everything you say could end up on the front page of the Times, and act accordingly. (I know someone who was fired for a private message)

8. Communicate way more than you think you need to.

Upwards, sideways, diagonally — whatever. Clarify constantly. When someone tells you something, repeat it back in your own words to confirm you’re on the same page. (Yes, I literally do this both out loud and in writing) Also super helpful in interviews to be sure you’re answering the right question.

9. You drive your relationship with your manager.

Come to your 1:1s with an agenda. Learn what motivates them and what will make them look good. Tailor your communication to their priorities (while also still getting what you need). Yes, trust them — but be strategic.

10. Build relationships with your peers.

Your network is your greatest long-term asset. Some of the best jobs, advice, referrals and lifelines come from your connections. Invest in them. Eat lunch with coworkers, if you can.

11. Teams vary wildly.

Culture, workload, emotional climate, technical challenge — it all shifts between teams. If one setup doesn’t work out, try another. It’s not a reflection on your worth if it doesn’t work.

12. Don’t choose a team just for the manager.

I’ve had six managers in 18 months. It sucks, but it’s the reality of a chaotic and dynamic industry and time. Managers move around. Pick a cool project and a company or culture that seems like a good fit overall.

13. You can absolutely (and should!) learn on the job.

Always aim high. Don’t wait until you feel 100% “ready.” You’ll grow the most when you’re a little uncomfortable. And yeah — moving jobs is still the fastest way to grow your salary.

14. Don’t job hop too fast.

This is the counterpoint to the last one: try to stay at a role at least 12–18 months, ideally 2–3 years. The exception is if it’s toxic. I’ve had jobs that made me cry daily, and nothing is worth that. I wish I’d left sooner.

15. If you’re curious about startups, try it before you start a family (assuming you eventually want to)

Startups are amazing in a lot of ways — but they often require flexibility and financial risk that’s harder to take on when you have kids or other obligations. If you’re young, mobile, and hungry, go for it.

16. All tech is not the same.

Silicon Valley tech, East Coast tech, government tech, consulting, contractor gigs — they’re all wildly different. Do your homework.

17. Networking events are honestly fucking awful and they’re a waste of your time 

In my experience, they’re mostly people looking for jobs. If you hate them, don’t feel bad. There are other ways to build relationships that aren’t so draining. You don’t need to go.

18. Be specific when asking for advice.

“Will you be my mentor?” is hard to act on. But “Can I ask you three questions about breaking into product?” or “Can I get a quick resume review?” — those are easier to say yes to. (And if you sent me a vague message, don’t worry — we’ve all done it.)

19. Yes, there are dummies and jerks. But…? Tech is full of amazing people.

I get to work with some of the smartest, funniest, kindest humans — men and women. I genuinely love it here. If you’re interested in tech, go for it.
And if you’re thinking about product management? Fuuuuck yeah. It’s the most fun job in the world, in my completely biased opinion.

That’s it!
Hope this helps — sending the biggest helpings of luck to all of you trying to figure this out. You’re not alone. You can do this. The industry needs more of you. And you don’t have to be perfect — you just have to keep trying.

I am a white female who’s currently on a team of Indian men who all reside in India. I am a fairly outgoing, friendly person and I have a good sense of humor, but I definitely don’t take it too far, nor do I overshare. I’m just comfortable being myself and historically I’ve been well-liked in the workplace. 

But with these men, it’s like because I’m friendly and warm, they see me as some kind of idiot. I produce excellent work and yet they never seem to take me seriously. They are all dead cold and serious, and I don’t think I’ve ever seen them just…be human. 

Other teams in our department are not like this at all. They have good rapport and are able to laugh, joke, and bond (within reason). But those teams also aren’t primarily comprised of offshore Indian men. 

So, I have to ask: Is this a cultural thing? As a white woman, or a woman in general, do you have to have a cold persona in order for Indian men to respect you at all?

I talked with many other women engineers who felt this same way. It's this combination of being smart and competent, but also having poor confidence in yourself, particularly when compared to a man.

This can be dangerous. You might work very, very hard to prove yourself. You might get taken advantage of by others since you're so useful. Worse, you might stop doubting yourself and develop more confidence, which makes you a threat. You become dangerous instead of useful.

Don't doubt yourself, honestly, since you are most likely doing much better than you think. But also be careful how you handle office politics, find sponsorship and not just mentorship, and brace yourself for people trying to put you in your place.

That's on them, not you, and you should honestly take this as a kind of compliment. They wouldn't feel threatened by anyone incompetent. If you really were just a ""diversity hire,"" you should be absolutely harmless to them, right?

I’m 35, have a master’s degree, a professional license, and I work in state govt, for context. I’m a talented analyst. I am excelling in my role, I successfully accused a former boss of hostile work environment and I won. Because I proved it. But I also had to advocate for myself and be flashy.

If you are good at your job, people are going to notice. If you’re ambitious and driven, they’ll notice. If you happen to be attractive on top of that, oh you’ll get noticed.

My advice:


- know the 48 laws of power. This will help you see when people are trying to manipulate you and help you work around it.

- you need to be ok with being disliked or envied. It’s just going to happen, no need to take it personally.

- if you’re up for it, get popular. Network internally and externally. Get known by other teams in your organization as being helpful and collaborative. If you get known for your skills, it will make it difficult for manipulators to have a leg to stand on when they play games.

- Pretty privilege is real, for better or worse. I’m a head turner so if it gets folks paying attention to me when ultimately I want to talk about data, I’m just glad people are hearing about the data!

- psychological safety in the workplace is so important. Take note of people around you that make you feel safe. Hopefully your direct supervisor falls under this. If not, your mental health may suffer.

- similarly, it helps to have an internal mentor or someone with clout looking out for you. Showing off your skill when high ups are around will help make this happen.

- know what your job is, do that job undeniably well, and be sure to communicate your results on record. 

- lean into any skills you have that mediocre white guys won’t likely be good at. Things like communication, organization, just don’t do admin/glue work. Show off that beautiful code you wrote and make sure they know it was written by you. Document your workflows and tactfully roll some out.

- it’s not arrogance if you can back up what you say. That’s just competence. Show off the competence you have.

- manage up judiciously. Make your boss’s job easier if you know they’ve got your back. Do not manage up if you don’t trust a situation, just do YOUR job.

- beware insecure men. They might seem nice and complimentary but if you know you’re talented, wait until insecure men come to understand this before you say too much around them. My boss told me one of my male peers is scared of me. As my therapist says, ‘that’s a him problem, not a me problem.’

- by default, coworkers are not friends. I’ve made real friends from work in the past but it took years to build trust. Everyone is ultimately out for themselves in the workplace.

- protect your energy. Communicate firm boundaries with a smile. Only you control how you react to things.

- find a good therapist if you can afford it. You’ll need it!",user_64,1455,111

HELP!,"I need advice I really hope someone has some ideas here…..  please read my career story and what happens in this famous global public Swedish company ro me… 

So this is a bit long story but I hope some of you can read it:

I’ve had a very long career in tech, I was only 19 when I started full time and I did my degree and all my additional university studies after work. 
 
I’m not trying to praise myself but just saying that I’ve always had a very good quick brain that’s capable ro do a lot and I’m good at getting things done. Becuse of my brain I can digest continuously massive amounts of information so I can keep learning constantly. 

At 27 I moved abroad for a job and got my very fist cro role from the company that sold for 80 million so it was a real company. I then started to work for the company that acquired us. This qS a big public global Swedish company. I relocated again and my role was to build a new development organization from scratch which I did. I had one year the best great to work numbers, I had one of the lowest rate of people leaving and my people delivered some pretty significant big projects. 

In the beginning when I relocated and started to build the team I was temporarily asked to take over their France operations as cro for six months which I did and found them a new cro and did evrytbhbf I was asked to do. What happened here was that since I had been given auddenly two roles I was told that I will get compensated for doing this cro role too but when I had already agreed to it and started the leadership told me that u her paid nothing from this. This is the first thing that happened that really stuck me the wrong way. 

I did good work through. Our cro personally came to tell me rhis, i was given stock options and I was chosen to this upcoming “future leader of company X” extensive training programs that would start 2 years later. 

Anyway, my team delivered all the projects we were supposed to but we also made a proposal to make pretty big change in testing. We finally presented rhis to the cro and rhus became a new global standard and they changed the whole testing organization according to our proposal and even fired the head of qa (which was not our idea or anything we ever mentioned even). 

At rbe end of my employment there my team build and delivered new front end architecture In matter of months and cut down rbe project time by over. Year. The head of global frint  end had failed to do this for 10 years already.. 

I was the only woman in global developmenr in leadedbuo position. So I was their face in wit and did public speaking and things like that. 


My pint is that I performed way beyond my goals and delivered much more than I was asked. 

But the longer I stayed, the more the sexism would bother me until it hit my face really hard. From the very beginning it was very common that my colleagues (who were at same leve as me) would have  meetings and make decisions on my area and responsibilities without including me. I had to ask several times to be involved but after fa month things always got back the way they were. 

At this point I had pretty extensive career behind me and some pretty big roles. On top of that I had a business degree, I had formal university program on strategies and strategic leadership. I had extensively studied leadership and even behavioral psychology. I did public speakin on it and built my expertise on this. For example. Since my brain was like a sponge and I’m wnxlessly interested in countless things I did also feed massive amounts of new information on anything I business related. Garbed business review I had resd every number for years by then. 

So then I reached a point where it was time to moce forward In my career. There as no new challenges anymore, I had simply reached my potential in that role and my manager (global head of dev) had known about it All along. 

I also need to mention ( this is very relevant later on this story) that when these big QA changes happened, they made a new department where I have number of my best most senior people. The head of rhis department was the same leve in organization as I was. All my colleagues (except the ones in Sweden) globally were previous CTOs of acquired companies and very experiences as I as too. They gave this role to the best friend of my Swedish colleagues who was the one who would purposefully exclude me from meetings and decision making. This guy again had very close relationship with our manager so it was easy for him to make sure his best friend gets this role. 

I knew he has no experience. He had been a developer for years, a manager for few years. That’s it. No relevant education what so ever. Soon it turns out that he was incredibly incompetent and clueless. In 6 months, only 5 person was left from all the people I gave him. All roles them left because of him. Super super senior riles that they had not. Even able to fill at least until I left the company a year later. I did get ro express my concerns when problems came uo from my ex people who would tell me what’s really going on. I did that very constructively and making sure I don’t point fingers. I was told to basically shut up and be a team player. His department was never able to imlplwnr the plans thay this team was build to do in the first place. 

I had to work with this guy at times and he was incredibly insufferable. He was so arrogant and even laughed at my face during one calll.  

I did have this one extra experience between here.and if Simones interested I can add that to comments because it was pretty nasty but this is too long is I write that too. 

This company has this internal rule that ALL roles must be open for 5 days for everyone to apply. The idea was to give a fair change to people but in reality it was just for show.all roles were dealt h before hand, I know because I managed to deal few great roles like this also for my people. But regardless it was a hard core rule and it was always made clear there’s no way around it. 

Then I get rhus email that the future leaders program will finally begin. I was very excited and did the first tasks and told my manager about it too over chat. He was quite surprised and asked me that so you got a slot to the program? I said yes I do. And then that’s it. He said. Nothing else. 

Auddenly I can’t access the program anymore. No one tells me why. I contact the program people and they said that I was dropped out of the selection process although there was no selection process. And that’s it…. I find out that others have continued to work on the tasks normally.. 

One day I get to work and I find out that there’s new organization changes. At this point I had not really spoken with my manager for 9 months. He never spoke to me and at some point I starts to feel like I annoy and bother him so stopped. 

Anyway then it’s announced that there’s new organization to global dev and they would open uo a role that’s directly above him in Sweden. New role. I obviously plan to apply and co side ring all my significant delivwries, my performance (I got the highest score all there years), my super high great place to work score, my education and experience I was thinking I have pretty good shit at it. But then BAM! This role is directly given to this arrogant guy, the best friend of my Swedish colleague (who also for similar promotion). 

No application process. No nothing. Rhus was the first time during my time In the company that’s they didn’t even pretend to interview people - and i don’t mean just tech but commercial  and all other teams too. 

So this guy who had merely few years of managerial experience, 0 educations what do ever (only has software developer), who was absolutely utterly the most incompetent leader I have ever seen, who lost alll my best people I had looked for a long time, coached, trained and grown - in few months he lost them. And he failed to deliver anything that he was supposed to in his previous role. 

Then I find out that my “Futuee Leaders of company X” Program was GIVEN TO HIM! When my manager found out I had a slot, he simply got be kicked out and my programs was given to him. 

The programs that was literally THE ONLY COMPENATION for being the CTO for Frances biggest service (that we did). I was lied to that I get paid to do a double job and then told I get nothing. And the program I for due to my performance was HANDED TO THIS GUY! 

I resigned. My manager acted very upset and tried to make me stay. He also put me in the system as “possible re-recruit”. He was very happy to recommend me and he said there’s new things for the company in six months and they want me back. I was pissed but wanted to leave on good term ask I bite my lip and leave. 

They didn’t even pay my bonuses which were 12k. Although I did every single thing that was reuiqred for them. 

I also found out that I got paid 30k less than my colleagues. All of them. All men. And I had no performance bonuses that they had on top. 
 
THE PROBLEM: 

I WAS ANGRY AND PISSED. So fucking angry and pissed. I was also not happy with myself. I was not in my 20a anymore building the foundation of my career. I was two time cro and he’d of dev from known global companies - why on earth did I not defend myself? Why did I bite my lip and said nothing. 

So I approached the company, I explained everything that’s happened, I demanded to get my 12k. They refused. And my manager took my recommendation. And made it clear that they will never ever recommend me for a job. Now this guy is promoted to CTO there. 

My problem is that I’m still pissed about this. I haven’t seen that there’s anything I can do about it though but I absolutely deserve at least my money. I have been in this  industry chiding a career as a woman’s I have rbe balls to defend myself and be on my own side. So that’s not a problem but is there anything at all I could do that doesn’t just make me look bad and cause me problems? I just think I deserve a better ending to this story.

The position I applied for was for one person, at the end  they decided to hire me and another person, a man, 10 years older and naturally with lots of job expertise. The managers don't know what they want, they don't understand the topic and there was zero guidance. I had to learn all by myself, as it was a new topic for me. The other guy in the same position is a very dominant character and talks for half an hour without a break and my ideas, which I try to bring across short and clear, are never heard or taken seriously. My ideas that I brought up months ago usually was then used some time later without giving me any credit, because then there were the other colleagues thoughts, until they finally understood it after months. 

Now the last week, something crazy started happening. The other guy is leading a project but will be away for some time, therefore I was asked to do it in the time where he is gone, months ago. But last week, suddenly managers started taking me into investigations to see whether I am capable of leading this project and ask me a lot of questions about the project and other subjects as to test me, some that I couldn't answer, because the take over meeting, I was asking for for weeks, didn't happen yet where all the responsibilities had to been given. I was told that the biggest chef doesn't believe that I can do it and I shouldn't go into holiday till the other guy is back, which is almost an entire year. This is a job in Northern Europe, so this is quite crazy expectation. 

Some months ago, I was told that I am taken away from a project without any explanation on to why, a manager had directly talked to the biggest chef, which never worked with me on the topic. I have until now had very good feedback in all work I have worked during my studies, and have very good diploma from a great university.

I work on a team of about 10 people, half men, half women. There is one man on the team who was promoted, despite the fact that he is one of the lowest performers on the team. He's super manipulative, and the majority of people on the team can run circles around him knowledge and performance wise. 

In years past he was busted for some kind of hanky panky with a younger female employee in the gym at our work. She got fired, but he stayed. There was another time he was supposed to take care of something important at work and a coworker tracked him down lounging at the beach. He's pretty infamous for being a grade A slimeball in the office I work in.

I have no idea why my manager decided to promote him. I'm sure he sweet talked her( gross!), and she has never actually worked with him in real life, so she doesn't know what he's really like. But it's so annoying because literally all he can do is smooth  talk. He's not particularly smart, resourceful, or knowledgeable. 

I'm told to go to him with questions and ask him for advice, despite the fact I have at least 12 years more experience in the field we work in than he does. And if I do  ask him something, he mansplains like nobody's business and treats me like im stupid. 

So anyway...I took a day off from work, and me and my significant other went to a local bar for lunch since we don't usually get the same days off. 

Who comes strolling into the bar with his work computer, but THIS GUY! We chat for a minute and he lies that he's doing ""some personal stuff"" on his work computer (which is expressly forbidden by the company I work at) and he orders a beer.

I'm not stupid. It's completely obvious to me that he is working as he sits at the bar with a beer. He's obviously a regular, and has a glass with his name on it. The  servers are all super friendly with him, and call him by a nickname when his food is ready. 

I'm an easygoing person so I played it off and haven't said anything to my manager, because nobody cares about anything I have to say anyway. But everyone jumps at what this guy has to say like it's manna from the heavens. 

Needless to say, I'm looking for a new job. But this whole experience was just so incredibly galling, and somewhat humiliating. I'm constantly treated like I'm speaking a different, unintelligible language when I bring up ideas in meetings, yet we have this fool working from the bar. Ugh!",user_1242,43,17

But as soon as this happened, it’s like my entire team, which happens to consist of all men, turned against me. No matter how well I did, they acted like I was insignificant and like I shouldn’t be taken seriously. They would criticize my work and talk over me. The Product Owner on my team started to take tasks out from underneath me, things that I was perfectly capable of handling. I would sit on calls where he would present and speak to my work as if it were his. None of this was discussed with me prior. 

It felt like they were trying to erase me completely, and it was blatant. It was aggressive. 

It became so uncomfortable and I felt so dominated that I’ve made the decision to leave. 

Clearly it seems like a case of jealousy, but I have never experienced this level of it and I can’t imagine that grown men would actually go this far. Is this really what men do when they feel threatened?

First round, they had two tech dudes interview me, one was actually respectful, the other was the White Tech Bro ^tm type who had only worked there 3 MONTHS and had no degree from CS or even stem related degree. Some undergrad business degree. I went through my technical solution outlining all my reasoning and logic, best practice standards and this guy interrupts and says at the end once I’ve concluded the design, modeling and testing validations I say at the end then we would automate the scripts to run on a schedule, “no you gotta do the automation upfront”…..automate what exactly…there is nothing to automate from the beginning, and why would I automate something that hasn’t been properly tested (???) I literally just designed the system. I tried to say my reasoning and logic in a polite and respectful way but this guy wasn’t having it. He wouldn’t explain his reasoning, and he suddenly just wouldn’t even make eye contact anymore, quickly ended the interview after only an hour and said I needed to leave. It was so demoralizing and I honestly don’t think I was rude, I just clearly had a different opinion and I showed the support for this decision with my technical logic. I don’t get it. HR came to escort me out promptly.

…? 

The break room workers sounded miserable tbh…I can’t even imagine working with this type of personality or that guy everyday. I am also extremely experienced and qualified for this role. I don’t understand. My unemployment ran out this week too, so yeah, not great. I like problem solving and the theoretical work of CS, but wow, the tech work culture is so demoralizing.

Hi everyone,
I’m a software professional with about 20 years of experience working in IT, mostly in consulting roles. While I’ve had a stable and well-paying career (compensation in the $150–160K range), I’ve reached a point where I no longer enjoy the work.

The constant shift in projects every 3–4 months, the need to stay updated with ever-changing technologies, and the pressure to always perform at the highest level has taken a toll on my mental. The stress often spills into my personal life, making it hard to be fully present with my family.

I’ve been wondering — is it possible to transition into a non-technical role after so many years in tech? I’ve always enjoyed connecting with people, building relationships, and socializing. But I’m not sure how to translate that into a viable career option. I just know that I want my 40s to be more balanced, fulfilling, and joyful.

If anyone has made a similar shift, or has suggestions for roles that align with people skills or any certificate programs I can take to upskill. I’d deeply appreciate your guidance. I’m at a crossroads and trying to figure out what comes next.

He also doesn't pretend to know what he's doing either which is ruining the reputation our office had before my old boss (40 something year old woman with multiple degrees and cerfticiates in higher education and administration) left.

His lack of knowledge is basically causing our office to feel like its starting to sundown. When I work remotely, no one is able to receive technical help, and he's not very knowledgable with our lms. I've been told he tells people he'll google their issues and get back with them, but gets a hold of me to contact them instead...like I'm not trying to complain that he's using google or asking me to handle it but in my opinion that's unprofessional way to tell someone you don't know, but then you're not even the one to reach back out with a solution?

Its caused our office to essentially lose a contract now as well.

- your ‘last job’ was a toxic environment filled with sexist, unethical dudes (the company got caught for *some* of it and had to pay out millions of dollars) who poisoned new hires against you, took credit for your work while telling higher-ups that you weren’t doing anything (and higher-ups never, ever cared about facts when one of their dudes claimed anything), and you were let go so that your manager could hire one of his friends to replace you. You were an award-winning, high performer otherwise. You even got a lawyer and won a small settlement over it and are now blacklisted from a company you worked for for over 20 years. [My usual go-to here is that the department I was in wanted to focus on a different product set than my specialty area (which is true) and we had to downsize after over-hiring during the pandemic (also true) but I don’t want it to sound like I don’t *also* have proficiency or interest in that product set, since that type of product is one that’s the basis of jobs I’m applying for. And if I say it was only the downsize then that makes me seem like a low performer which isn’t true at all. It’s also hard to get a reference from my colleagues because they have been told to not talk about me per the settlement - but who knows what lies they were told too]. 

- that happened over 2 years ago; when you were let go you ended up getting frozen shoulder in both arms and couldn’t move your arms above the elbow for over half a year, then had to deal with other general life/personal issues. [It seems like saying that I wasn’t constantly looking for a job might sound dishonest even though it’s true, and I don’t want to bring up medical or personal issues. I’ve sent out resumés here and there and had a few dozen interviews, but it’s been a mixed bag of immediate rejection, recruiters who love me but then I get ghosted by the hiring manager, and doing multiple interviews and getting rejected in the last stage.]

- any other interview questions that you feel folks here could use some brainstorming on? I feel that sometimes all of the charts and advice on ‘here’s how to answer these questions’ get so overdone that they come across as fake.

I realized I don't want to make bullshit ppts (the analysis and data visualization part is fun but the overall product was not exciting for me) and that I really want to be a programmer. 

I guess what I want to ask you guys is how do I go about doing this with bills to pay? Bootcamps were my first option but that will take months to a year before I apply for an entry level role. I just learned that apprenticeships are a thing but 2025 cohorts already done applying and ideally, I would prefer remote work (I hope that doesn't sound entitled, it's just how I've envisioned a career). Does anyone know of any platforms where I can find them, maybe learn and work under a mentor or something similar? Do we have paths like these? Or do I just slog through whatever work I can get somehow and study in the after- hours and fingers crossed it goes well?

Sorry if anything comes off as entitled, arrogant or spoiled. I do not intend for it to. Genuinely asking for insight. ",user_1254,1,17

When I started I wasn’t using anything really but my knowledge, but the company bought us all Cursor in order to decrease time it takes to ship features. Now I’m constantly stressed out to meet short deadlines and feel like I’ve lost everything I knew about developing without AI - which means I also feel trapped because I’m not sure if I could get another job now. I’m a bit despondent because I really prided myself on the amount of things I knew as a more junior developer with only a few years experience and it’s just all gone.

I used to love the creative problem solving aspect of coding but that is all gone now.

If your job search is dragging on, what did you find to do in the meantime to keep your skills fresh and to maybe make some money?

Last year I left a toxic job, where I had been high performing, but my mental health was suffering and I really needed a break. I didn't know it was going to be so difficult to re-enter the market. It's challenging, but doable, to get interviews, but even when you get interviews the expectations are sky-high - I feel they expect absolute perfection these days. I'm more than willing to put in some more time and effort to improve my interview skills, but in the meantime my savings are dwindling, my stress is increasing, and my mental health is declining (which isn't helping my interview performance - I feel like a dark cloud is hanging over my head).

I've been thinking that, maybe if I had some money coming in, I could relax a little bit and keep searching but not be so ridiculously stressed about the job search. Maybe contract work? Or some type of part time or freelance work? Is anybody doing anything like that or has any ideas? Is there any temporary or slightly less desirable work in this market that has a lower bar to entry?

....

Also... as a woman in tech I worked so hard for years to build up my confidence and feel like I am ""good enough"" to get to the next level in my career.

I’ve been working at this engineering firm for the last several years (over five, under ten). The company is old and international. It’s been a wild ride on the corporate train, but it definitely has its perks. I’ve stayed this long because I genuinely enjoy most of the people I work with. The engineers are a good mix of many generations, mostly male. Everyone on my team works from home. My hours are technically set, but in reality, they’re flexible. The benefits aren’t bad. Sounds pretty good, right? Then why do I dread logging on every day?

I moved teams less than a year ago, and I can’t decide whether or not I made a mistake. It’s my direct manager I’m so conflicted about. I’ve known him since I started at this company. We worked at the same site (before going remote), had similar interests and became work friends, worked on projects together, hung out at group outings, and chatted. I really do think he’s a kind person—he seems to really love his family and makes quality time for them, he volunteers for various charities, and he makes an effort to genuinely connect with people. But that doesn’t necessarily make him good management material.

This team was formalized a couple of years before I joined, so it’s still relatively new. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt because they were still forming the team, but it’s bad. There was no structure when I started. No cadence of team meetings. No tracking of individual projects—so, no management of timelines. No team policies written. I was never really onboarded or trained for my new position. The only thing I can pinpoint is that they’ve just been fielding customer requests with no traceability outside of email communications. They haven’t been keeping a repository of the information they’ve collected, even though our work requires diligent record-keeping. We are subject to audits.

His communication style is also difficult to deal with. He never sets a meeting with an agenda unless multiple people are involved. He usually just calls me up, goes on an ADHD-fueled word vomit of gossip and possible work instructions, and then forgets most of what he said. He never takes notes. He uses far too many words to explain something simple. He’s just all over the place. On top of that, I have to manage his feelings—a lot. He can get defensive.

I am fucking floored. I wish that were the worst of it, but I’m almost certain they’ve collectively been fucking off for about 70% of this team’s existence. The sad part? I can tell the other people on my team are craving structure and the feeling of actually succeeding at their jobs… and that’s exactly what I’ve been doing behind my manager’s back.

For the past four months, I’ve been managing the team. Another teammate—who started shortly after me and happens to be the only other woman on my team—and I have been pulling everything together. I have a decoy “Team Meeting” that my manager is invited to. The real team meetings happen twice a week. We track tasks and take detailed notes. I’ve set up two additional working meetings with different teammates to establish policies and drive progress on urgent projects. And honestly? It’s been going really damn well. The engineers are all on board and have started coming to me for project questions. We are getting things done and it’s amazing!

My dilemma? I’m not the manager. But I am doing manager things. I want credit for it. I don’t necessarily want him to get fired—I just want the team to be recognized as productive and valuable. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to quit my job. I like everyone on my team—I just don’t like the current dynamic. Right now, I’m managing up and down. And I’m doing that on top of my actual job. I’m in a pickle.

I ask every morning (if I have no outstanding work from the day(s) prior and have zero tasks) what he’d like me to do/work on/focus on, and today he told me to “keep working on making a time server”. He gave me this task a couple days ago during another task drought of mine, and I finished it within an hour and tried to stretch out the task for an hour or so more since I knew he was struggling to come up with one for me. 

Then yesterday evening, he told me to work on it again :/ so I was reading the RFC for NTP, then I started looking at other client-server stuff, then that devolved into looking at home server ideas. 

This morning, I asked him what the agenda for today is, and he admitted that this is “the calm before the storm” because he’s busy preparing for demos and other stuff that our company has and said that me and the other junior aren’t gonna have anything to do, so he told me to focus on the time server stuff again. I mentioned that I worked on that yesterday and added that I started looking into home server stuff because I’d like to make one for myself, and he looked confused so I had to give him an example, the first coming to my mind being a Plex server. Well, my mistake because he said that’s a bit too off-topic and I should focus on the time server.

I feel like I’m at a loss, just sitting here pretending to be “busy”. I’m reading through this RFC document, reading through connection handlers that I’ve found in our code (which I’ve done for hours before in previous situations like this), and I don’t really know what else to do? I’m gonna try to make a chat between two clients (I’ve done this in college so I guess it’s relevant and would be good to review), but I swear I’m about to just start leetcoding since I’m very shabby at that, or start studying for certifications.

It just bothers me because I wish so badly that we could have a couple days of remote work, especially for times like this. Apparently, from my talks with a couple others here, the reasoning is partly because our superiors are close-minded and have only ever worked at this company their whole lives so they don’t understand and won’t consider any sort of wfh. I could be getting lots of chores done that I usually have to stave off until the weekend due to my long work hours. 

What makes it even worse is that I’ve been trying to work extra hours to make up for six hours I’ll lose on Thursday for driving to an appointment, which is a whole other thing because they made it out like if I had an appointment, I could just leave no problem (like a give and take type of thing with the company) but we have to track our tasks with 15-min gratuity and put our hours into spreadsheets, so if I don’t make up the time I just won’t get paid for it or have to take PTO, and I need my PTO for a trip this summer. I could go without getting paid but that doesn’t feel very good either. Sorry this sort of turned into a rant :( maybe this is a lesson many people have to learn how to manage?

My organization has offered voluntary layoffs. I, like so many other people, struggle within a considerably toxic team--where I am consistently undermined and patronized with hints of misogyny.

In fact, this was one of several factors impacting my health that led me to require taking a leave of absence. I've been on leave for 10 months.

My first thought when hearing the news of voluntary layoffs was one of relief. However, upon further reflection, I'm not so sure. The economy and job market is very turbulent. My current job has wonderful benefits and ideally I would stay with the company. Before I left, I had a chat with my director. He was open to the idea of transitioning to a sister team. I've reached out to him since, but he has declined to speak with me until I've returned to work--I took this as a sign that it is no longer a possibility. On top of that, annual reviews were recently released and the verdict was not good. No doubt, this is in part due to the LOA; but I also spoke up frequently about what I considered to be poor scoping decisions, and this did not help, either.

With the voluntary (and involuntary layoffs I assume will follow) there would be restructuring--giving at least the possibility that my situation would improve. If not, I can always choose to resign. I am having a difficult time grappling with the idea of voluntarily leaving behind the chance at financial freedom in the near future and a career that I had fantasized about. I feel cheated because I know that I can do the work and perform well. I have a PhD in the sub-domain that I'm working in for the company.

I've thought about neglecting the voluntary layoff. I may be laid off anyway, but that is not within my control and I would not be in any worse of a position; if anything, it would allow for another 1-3 months pay, depending on how long and if they do indeed perform traditional layoffs. Ideally, I would continue to stay on leave until all of the dust settles from this during the next 2-3 months.

My primary concern is that being on leave at this point requires an approved ADA accommodation from the company and will need renewal soon. They may, in light of all this, decide to reject the request to extend the leave. I don't know how common this is--I've read that often companies try to avoid doing this for fear of lawsuits (although, I'm well aware that employees on mat and pat leave have not been spared in other tech layoffs).

If the ADA extension request is rejected that may be grounds for immediate termination in which case I would lose any severance had I elected to take the layoff package. I am also very tired of dealing with the entire situation and realize that a fresh start might be the best possible outcome--unfortunately, the job market and uncertainty is creating a lot of stress and doubt. I fear the economic climate is clouding my judgment and I wonder if I should heed to these thoughts and concerns.

I'm doing undergrad in compsci rn and I've been wanting to work in tech since I was really young because it's what I'm interested in and my father works in engineering and he encouraged me to go into it too.

The thing is the more I learn about the field as I get older the more I'm intimidated and terrified by it. Also I've realized I was kinda lied to naively when I was younger when my father and his colleagues would tell me how easy girls have it in tech because there's no women and companies ""have to"" hire some women. I was like 11, I didn't know they were being misogynistic and that actually the only women that made it that far are ones that excel above and beyond all of them.

I burned out academically after high school because it was brutal competition in my country and I was really privileged that my family could afford for me to study undergrad in Canada so I can escape our system but it's just more hurdles tbh out here with being poc and not having permanent residency/citizenship. I already feel how isolating it is on campus and trying to apply for internships and I hear terrifying stories about how it is in the field and I'm so so scared about having to bear that pressure so many more folds because at least university administration is run by more women. 

I do love what I'm studying and it's something I've wanted to do since I was like 10 and if it was possible I'd wanna do postgrads and be in academia but it's becoming more and more financially inviable because my dad has terminal cancer and I feel much more pressured to have a career instead of pursuing studies. But I'm just so scared. I've already felt so defeated by my experiences of applying for internships and bitter about the opportunities not afforded to me. I'm worried the actual experience trying getting into the field will crush me. 

I guess I'm just wondering if things will ever feel easier and less isolating and if it's really so bad in the field. It's also frustrating that I don't know any women that work in tech and all the other women I talk to are like it can't be *that bad* or I just need to try and be socialable but I've already been sexually harassed and assaulted by men/boys in the tech/engineering circles growing up I don't know how much more I can put up with 😞

I feel that what I'm asking for is fairly basic, and yet I'm getting a surprising amount of push back. Am I nuts? Do I have absurd expectations? Please tell me because I am feeling very confused, LOL

* Statement: I want a job that I enjoy
   * Feedback: no job is going to be fun all the time and you should not expect to get fulfillment from work. Get that from hobbies. Clock in, produce, clock out. 
* Statement: I want a workplace where it's OK to fail sometimes
   * Feedback: failure is never OK and you absolutely cannot say this to employers
* Statement: I would like some time and space for career development (courses, networking opportunities, mentorship, etc)
   * This is an unreasonable expectation; do all that outside of work 

Truth be told, I don't expect to get most of this in the current job market. What is very confusing to me is that when I say any of the above statements, they are interpreted in the most black-and-white, all-or-nothing sense. Obviously I understand no job will be super fun all the time and that personal development takes a back seat to deadlines and deliverables. And I would NEVER tell management or stakeholders, ""Sorry, I failed,"" and leave it at that. But am I really asking for that much? To me, this feels like a MVP to avoid burnout at a place that will be using 3/4s of my waking hours throughout the week. Why are people acting like these things are absurd?",user_845,15,15

Here’s their summary:

> In this article, brand strategist and visibility expert N. Chloé Nwangwu argues that “underrecognized” is more accurate than — and a more productive alternative to — the word “underrepresented.”

> Nwangwu argues that “underrepresented” fails because it shifts our focus away from the leaders, the institutions, and the systems that have the power to sustainably change the status quo. Instead, it puts the onus on the socially marginalized person.           

> “Underrepresented” also suggests that the solution to inequity is for leaders to place marginalized social groups into very visible positions while simultaneously failing to give them the tools needed to overcome individual and systemic biases. Then, it winks knowingly should this group not manage to beat the odds, again.

> “Underrecognized,” on the other hand, invites us to address the behavior driving underrepresentation: a lack of recognition. It makes the real problem more visible, and puts the responsibility of change on the discriminators and the systems that enable and trap them.

After the nth burnout, I've come to realize having energy to do the things I enjoy and tinker beyond work is much better than the fuckery of workplace bs and butthurt intimidated colleagues.

It doesn't mean I'm clock watching or slacking off either, I just do what's asked well, and nurture good relationships at work. I do more when it's interesting but I won't go above and beyond or suggest areas of improvement, or work above my level anymore. No good deed goes unpunished; It's simply not needed.

I'm East Asian, late thirties, look like I'm 25 and have huge ADHD energy. I don't have a CS degree and basically barrelled through ~4 dead end jobs, am on my 8th job, found a niche I was ultra interested in becoming real good at (front end led to design systems, but now I'm more interested in everything else now)

I've been canned 3x in the first few years with dead end jobs. In the 3 years before last year I kept trying to prove myself or get promoted to a senior role. I taught many mid level devs to unit test and directed a non profit tech community before. In the last 2 roles I've had insecure or threatened managers or senior devs talk down to me or deliberately withhold info. It's exhausting. I've been feeling stuck, but recently began working through some childhood trauma issues around conflict avoidance and people pleasing. Until I build better confidence, I don't think I'll be able to deal with more. 

Last year I left a corporate lead dev role and stepped down as a non profit exec director for a tech community. I wanted to work with a manager I worked well with again... and this is how I found myself in a domain similar to the tobacco industry. He was one of few to ever make me feel visible. There was a growth plan towards staff or engineering manager at first but I wasn't given any projects to demonstrate my potential, I got mixed messages from him and managers about expectations of my role. If I work at my level I'm told it's not needed. If I don't then I can't hit my goals (and I'm bored af with the tasks I'm assigned that are at most intermediate). The relationship has soured somewhat, and he became more micromanagey due to business pressure, so I'm just doing what's asked and no more. 

I started working on an open source project with an experienced friend and mentoring some folks in the community. It's really energized and challenged me. 

I think about trying to do a founding eng role when the economy turns around to experience a different level of challenge instead of ending up at the same level and needing to prove myself yet again, alter my personality while in leadership at larger orgs.

I've been sleeping more and limiting how much extra I volunteer for at work. 

Big epiphany: 

It's not your problem if your work can't leverage your brilliance and drive.

Create your own path and gather your guns!

I am a backend engineer for 12+ years. I have been with my current company (Saas) for 5+ years.

The past 2 years have been hell for me in my company. The VP level management changed and there were re-orgs constantly and I was moved teams and managers 6 times. I was told I have leadership skills to be a manager and moved teams every time cos that team will have a manager position open up soon. After moving 5 teams, I realized I was being played as I would give my best to get things done. 

9 months ago, I was being moved the 6th time I fought hard and said absolutely not. My VP called me and basically strong armed me to move. He said this is definitely where I would get a promotion. There was a high visibility time sensitive work for a product launch in September. Also, September is usually when we get our promotions. So I assumed if I do the work I would get a promotion right away. I made sure my new manager knew my career intentions in the first one on one. The whole team is front end engineers with minimal backend knowledge but the project was mostly backend. So I was not only accountable for the work but also lacked a strong team. Some are decent engineers and did a good job. I covered for slackers. The project went live without issues.

After that I ask my manager for a promotion in September and he didn't have anything. The meeting got heated when I was assertive about my demands. I knew he was going to react negatively. But he also shared the conversation with the team during happy hour and half of them retaliated towards me by being hostile in the office. After contemplating I decided to smooth things over with my manager by apologizing for the heated conversation. I didn't apologize for asking for a promotion. But I had decided to not ever be a manager for him. Try to find a job (difficult in this tech market) and do my current job well to justify my paycheck. He thinks we are good.

This week he hinted at a promotion by offering more work with his other team and saying it will showcase my leadership skills. I declined by saying it doesn't interest me. As the promotion talk is not yet open, I have some time to give him an excuse. But my real reason is I don't trust him and the team to have my back.

- promotes boot camps (nothing wrong with boot camps. I went to boot camp, too. But in the year of 2025, you will have harder time than me many years ago finding a full time job with boot camp cert)
- spreads tech misinformation such as AI can do everything and replace everyone
- shares all of the shiny benefits working in tech

None of them talks about
- detailed dive-in to any technology they promote
- the fact that it takes years to become a good and solid engineers
- there are tons and tons of discriminations against women in tech

And the fact that companies like Code Academy only collaborates with all of these beautiful women who dress in skirts and cropped tops is so disheartening. Don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing wrong to dress whatever you want. I dress like that, too. But I feel like these boot camps and women tech influencers create and promote the delusions that women engineers not only have to be savvy in tech but also perfect in how we look.

I remember a few tech conferences I went in the past couple years. Women are already the minority in those conferences, but many I am not exaggerating many men in the conferences prefer to talk with young and blond women instead of experienced women engineers who are not young and beautiful. I remember the first time I observed the phenomenon, I was shocked and concerned.

How do fellow women in tech think? 

Disclaimer: nothing wrong dressing up! I love fashion and love dressing up when I go to the office.

COVID forced me out of a role I loved (data/DB team into Product Management), and while I like it okay, it is definitely not my passion as much as anything data-oriented. I do love my company though, and I don't hate my job. I am well-rounded and self-taught for a lot of my skills, so can step into most any spot (except heavy dev) and have held about 8 progressive, different roles inside my company.
I had been considering looking around for managerial level data roles, but honestly my age and the current job market gave me second thoughts. So now I am considering starting a side business. It's either that, or hope for the best, or potentially trying to transition into a less technical role.

Background given.... and my question is this: Does anyone think there's a marketable need for data analysis & reporting services for smaller businesses? A fractional data analyst is a side business idea I've considered, and it would be nice to build up a backup in case I were to get laid off or something in the future.

So it’s Friday, and the last thing I want to do is think about drama or work politics.

Here’s the deal: My boss plays favorites and can be a bully to the people he doesn’t like. One of my coworkers noticed a weird issue with the database, and my boss tells him to ask another coworker for help. I’m convinced that this coworker is his favorite and that my boss is trying to position him as some kind of manager. Fine, whatever, as long as he's not my manager and I can still tell him to “stuff it” if I need to.

What really gets under my skin, though, is the fact that my boss knows I did the coding for this project, yet he still refers the issue to this coworker. It honestly boils my blood that my work is being attributed to this guy who I honestly think has no real talent. It’s one thing to play favorites, but to completely overlook who actually did the work?

Anyone else deal with this kind of workplace favoritism? How do you handle it when you feel like your hard work is being undermined? Am I just being paranoid?

I didn’t come into tech the traditional way. I started out as an administrative assistant—smart, hungry, always trying to get a foot in the door to do the work, not just support the people doing it. I worked at a defense contractor, then commercial real estate. Everyone kept telling me how bright my future was, how I had “project manager energy,” etc., but somehow, the promotions never came. I was stuck as a high-level EA, no matter how capable I was.

Eventually, I decided to stop waiting for recognition and just applied to every well-reviewed company in my area. Admin work can get your foot in the door anywhere. That’s how I landed at a top 10 biopharma company—supporting a senior executive who happened to be a progressive, openly gay man. He was one of the few who actually mentored me, gave me real autonomy, and saw my potential. He told me he’d manage his own calendar—he wanted me to work with his leadership team and find where I could make an impact.

That’s how I met the head of oncology, who eventually offered me an entry-level project management role. The work was highly technical, and HR required a master’s degree in science or engineering—but I had a master’s in education from an earlier career detour, so that technically checked the box. I crushed the interviews and was offered the role.

Here’s where it gets infuriating: the salary range posted for the role would’ve given me at least a 50% raise. But HR refused to give me even the lowest end of the range because, and I quote, “We can’t give someone a 50% raise.” So they gave me a good raise—but one that was still way below what someone in that role should’ve earned.

My new boss was livid. She tried to make it right. She gave me the biggest raise she could, and as a workaround, paid me out a massive bonus—2.5x my target—to bring me closer to where I should’ve been. She did this again the next year, and the next, until after four years, my salary finally caught up to my peers.

You’d think this is a win, right? Not really. Because those four years of underpayment didn’t just hurt me then—they hurt me for years afterward. Every job offer after that was based on a salary history that was artificially low. Bonuses don’t show up on offer letters. And because I stayed at that company for seven years, the compounding loss was massive.

Why did this happen? Because I came from a “pink collar” job. Because I was an admin, a role overwhelmingly filled by women, my entry point into tech was penalized—even when I moved into a technical, male-dominated function. I broke the glass ceiling, sure—but the shards cut me for years.

I know I’m not alone in this. I know so many women have stories like this—especially those who came into tech through non-traditional paths. I just wanted to share mine in case someone else out there is feeling the same thing: that even when you win, the system finds ways to keep you just a little behind.

The first year I was very sick due to the stress of the move and adjusting to being completely alone with no help or support and then the next three years spent trying to claw an AS out. I can't work while going to school- I've done it in the past and it ended up with me in the hospital. I have a number of chronic conditions that have resulted in me losing jobs when I get sick.

So now I'm looking at going back to work with a 4 year gap, and I'm almost 30 with a measly associates to show for it. I won't be able to get my BS- that would be another few years out of work and I can't afford that.

I feel at least competent enough to go back to helpdesk, but nothing more. I'm definitely never getting into the actual Cybersecurity work- I just got the degree because I liked the spread of classes more than the general IT degree. I think the chances of me going far are limited, not only due to my disability but because I'm a woman. I don't have anything that stands out, so I need to take what I can get and be happy about it. 

My husband seems to think I can do anything, and from his position I can. We've been co-workers more often than not and he's seen me be rapidly promoted but he doesn't get the these were dead end jobs where they just wanted someone with a pulse and good notation skills. I used to be a lot more confident in my work but I've grown up, the hope and naivety is gone.

I'm not saying women can't succeed in tech, they do every day, but you have to be special to succeed and I'm not that person. I've only ever been good as the pack mule of the team that can reliably churn out work and you never have to see otherwise. I'm not the kind of person that can speak out in meetings and if I'm mistreated I just leave. There's no point in fighting, nothing actually changes when you do.

I'm thinking I've made a mistake thinking I could cut it out in tech. I don't know what else I'd do- I'm good with cars. A local dealership tried to hire me on the spot a little while ago but I'm disabled and the work would probably kill me. It's why I've gone down the road of tech, I needed something that I could do even on the days I can't walk without pain. 

I don't know what I'm looking for in advice, in just feeling hopeless. I've been reading here for awhile and it seems that things are worse than I remember. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to succeed and I'm realizing that I'm not that kind of caliber.

I'm just scared I've wasted my time and money, but no one has a crystal ball I guess. I'm sure I can at least get can to help desk. After that? I don't know. ",user_1278,11,13

I’m a UX/UI designer working for a small local tech agency. I’m about 2 years into this career. Previously worked as a graphic designer.

I’m 30, going on 31 and feeling so lost.

I don’t know if I hate the field, or if I hate the company I work for. I was so excited when I started and my enthusiasm has been slowly replaced by dissatisfaction and apathy. No one respects what I do at my job. I’m not given opportunities to show what I can really do. I tried to offer suggestions and push to make things better in the beginning but I get told no every time. I just don’t care anymore. It’s starting to impact my performance.

I’ve started to apply to new jobs, but with 2 years of UX experience I barely have enough to get another job. All of the jobs I see are for “Senior” UX/UI professionals. The over-saturation of this field due to bootcamps has only increased competition naturally as well. I’m feeling so discouraged. I don’t know if it’s worth going back to school (I already have 58k of student loan debt). 

I just need some guidance, encouragement, or anything you can offer possibly. Most UX forums on here are not friendly environments to talk about this stuff. People just say to get used to it and get over it basically.

I work at AT&T (not particularly afraid to name and shame anymore) and the rush to scrub the word ""diversity"" from everything in sight has been jarring. First, I noticed our DE&I organization was renamed to ""Culture and Inclusion"". So whatever, it's a name change to keep that sweet federal funding coming in, I guess.

Then I hear of messages coming out from that same organization that those people are now tasked with scrubbing the word ""diversity"" from being mentioned anywhere and trying to find website owners who can do so. Which seems kind of sick to bend the same organizations against its original intent, but it seemed like they were mainly targeting their own initiatives so... okay.

Cut to today where my team just had to refine a user story that removes any mention of supplier diversity on our project. And beyond the fact that this is the first time this issue has directly darkened my own doorstep, it's just profoundly saddening to me.

Believe it or not, AT&T was one of the good guys once. Amidst the civil rights movement in 1968, AT&T was one of the first US corporations to create a targeted program that specifically included MWBEs in its supply chain. It's something they've historically continued to talk about -- that one time they were on the right side of history. But oh how quickly they've cowtowed to the new regime, almost as if they don't actually care anymore and are relieved they get to stop pretending.

Now when suppliers are onboarded to our product, that data will no longer be collected. Sure, we'll probably still work with them. Maybe meritocracy will even work just this once and we won't descend into the borderline (if not outright) nepotism of the olden days. Who knows.

And it could certainly be successfully argued that in many cases, the removal of any mention of diversity is as hollow as the inclusion of it to begin with. They used to hedge their bets on their consumer base being more left-leaning, now they're hedging it on the federal government (and their ability to bid for federal contracts) and their uber wealthy shareholders which are overwhelmingly right-leaning. Certainly not a financially stupid move in the short term, and I imagine no one was actually expecting AT&T to be one of the good guys anyway so... I'm sure no one is blown away by this news. I'm not surprised to see the facade crumble, just a little disappointed that I was right about it being a facade.

Anyway, I've complained enough from my own side but I'm curious if this is happening to other large US companies. Obviously no need to name and shame if you're not comfortable, I have the luxury of being as financially secure as I am annoyed right now. I just want to get a feel for how many companies are folding like the cheap suits they always were.",user_1011,103,15

Background: I’m in my mid 30s been in tech or tech adjacent for 12 years. Spent 9 years at one company literally from admin to director. Worked in some startups/ freelance gig and now in a dream PM role. 

Issue: I’ve been “training” with the Product Manager who is supposed to be handing over PM responsibilities to me. However as she started handing things over and singing my praises to internal and external stakeholders/teammates she’s also going behind my back when requests are publicly made to fulfill them. The contract consultant we work with does not present issues to me as directed or treat me with respect (belittling my knowledge). 

Leadership: our manager is well aware and he is ready to put her in her place has expressed his confidence in me and we’ve been working hard on roadmapping planning for the future 

Perception: I’ve chatted with other business units we’ve worked with to get a big picture on their experience making requests getting things accomplished etc (they have expressed concern with resistance…pushing to get “things that absolutely can’t be done” done and working up until the 11th hour when it’s not entirely necessary) 

Example: A marketing team member had a question about promotional functionality, she asks in a group chat and said individual sends her a direct message to discuss. 

Steps I’ve taken: I’ve discussed a plan to transition, I’ve proven through projects I am more than capable, I’ve ask questions when needed. I’ve done all sprint planning, backlog grooming deployment notes retrospectives … not sure where to go from here. 

Summary: I am a PM with a tenured peer moving into a new role and she won’t turn over responsibilities to me, after being told to do so and telling our manager she has done so. What do I do/ what strategies do I try now?

For example we were asked to showcase his work for a monthly spotlight - I helped him build the deck for 2 weeks staying until 8pm to make sure it was in a good state and practice with him. Unfortunately, our contract gets minimal power apps work, so as business has shrinked given the current environment his project abruptly ended. I scrambled to get him any work so that he could stay afloat on our contract. I advocated asked everyone I knew to check if They had any work. Luckily we were able to find him small projects to stay afloat .

Today he stops by my desk bc and we discuss projects and he asked for feedback. I thought it was about our projects so I said I had none. Seeing that's what we disucced.

The kicker is he called our pm - and asked to be rolled off and said that I was a micromanager and the the couldn't grow under my leadership.

I started a new job a little while ago, and I'm pretty damn good at it.

However, I'm the youngest, possibly, in this department within our greater ITS team.  I'm also in a director-level leadership position.  I'm also very femme-presenting but openly non-binary.

  
I'm beginning to feel dismissed in conversations (strategy, collaborative, etc.) and talked down to in emails and over projects from, primarily, my peers and people one role title above me.  Almost all of them are men (with the exception of one woman).  I keep hearing over and over some of the following things in response to sharing my opinion, directive, and collaborative feedback:

* ""I've been doing this for 30 years and...""
* ""Your team used to report to me, therefore...""
* ""A little bit of advice..."" <— this always comes after me defending a decision or standing up for myself 
* Or just generally not answering me in email or on calls

I feel like I'm crazy, walking a thin line between overreacting about gender bias/micro-aggressions (and probably ageism) and downplaying how I'm perceived and treated.  I try my best to take a step back from situations I find myself in and look at it from every perspective.

But honestly?  I feel extremely dismissed, and because it's almost entirely men *and* I'm the youngest, it really does feel like, ""Well, you're a young woman in IT, therefore..."" **AND IT SUCKS!**  And it wears me down.

It's suggestion was  “Let your male co-founder talk about the tech choices — you can talk about Gen Z trends and color palettes.”

I’m building my startup for the past 6+ months.

I’ve made architecture decisions, written backend and frontend code, worked on recommandation, data layers, deployments , all of it.

Yes, my co-founder and I are building this together, but that suggestion was a reminder of something deeper:

Even on 2025 AI still reflect gender bias.

They learn from the internet and the internet still assumes the man is the “tech guy,” and the woman does the “soft stuff.”

Positive post and examples,"I'll start. I'm a female principal engineer (and a mom) at a unicorn tech start-up, and I work with mostly male tech leads (and about 200 engineers). I'm senior to 99% of them and my job is to get them to collaborate across teams and maintain a healthy codebase without ruffling feathers. Here's what I've learned after several years in this role.

- The person who delivers the compliments holds the power. I don't mean sucking up or flirting your way to the top, I mean honest feedback like ""You handled that well and I think the project is off to a good start"" or ""You have a good eye for frontend performance and I'm glad I can trust you to catch those issues before they bog us down."" I'm not a manager, but I do hold a lot of career growth cards and I don't mind letting people know it in these subtle ways. Honestly I do this with my own managers as well; managing ""up"" is really powerful. ""I appreciated when you gave me the opportunity to speak on that topic. You made sure people listened."" (Sometimes this is a stretch, but you can usually bet they'll be influenced by this feedback.) You don't even need to smile or elaborate; the honest positive feedback when appropriate is enough. 

- Be unruffled and unapologetic, but also leave things better than you found them. You're going to make mistakes, people are going to lash out, and others will constantly test you (or worse, dismiss you). It's all a personality test at the end of the day, and everything is a learning opportunity. You're allowed to mess up; own it calmly and deliberately and keep pressing forward. You're allowed to not always be an expert at something: ""I should know more about this topic, so I'm determined to fix that. Anyone else want to learn with me?"" Let your drive to resolution be bigger than the problem, and then follow through. Take up space as you grow and let the outcomes speak for themselves.

- Document everything. Leave paper trails on every decision and contribution. Post in public channels on Slack or Teams. Reply All. Summarize decisions from private meetings or DMs in public spaces. This isn't just a safety net but a reminder to everyone of what you do in your role and that you're a self-appointed leader in your own right.",user_1045,75,5

I have a M.Sc., worked on the first YouTube codec backend, a satellite, high performance computing for Intel, WiFi, audio firmware, , and lastly mass storage.  I’m familiar with C/C++, Python, Go, etc.  Languages are just tools to me.  I’ve done front end down through backend API, to driver, firmware, and even minor DSP.

And I hate this industry.

Unfortunately, it’s a bit more complex than simple ‘hate’.  I sincerely don’t care beyond a means of income and I’ve fully accepted that I’ve hit a ceiling I’ll never surpass.  I am usually someone who gets above expectations reviews and I’ve typically only lost work through choice of my own or VCs closing shop.

This time around, I found myself just staring at the screen utterly unmotivated.  I recently lost my job of 3.5 years.

But here’s the rub.  I’m sick of the very nature of this industry.  There is never any collaboration, never any kindness.  Just type A competition from men who need me to fall into one of two categories; bitch or innocent doe.

I’ve spent years developing the personality required to filter ideas through men, never be “too assertive”, never share code or ideas until I was prepared to defend them to the death. No “Hey I was thinking about doing X, here’s a draft.  Whatcha think?’.

Danger mode all the time.  That’s why I got good reviews.  Terror and 70-80 hour work weeks.

Is someone falling behind?  Is someone having a bad week?  They’re “trash’.  The company needs “only a players”.  I’ve survived so much turnover and much of the time it was never deserved.

Does a manager ask “How can I help this person be successful?” or “are we setting clear expectations?”.  Or heaven forbid, “how can we all help as a team and help this person grow?’.  Never happened in what I’ve seen in 20 years.  People just smell blood and isolate anyone who sticks out.

The other irony?  I’m a trans woman.  I’ve lived as a woman my entire adult life, and have had the good fortune of flying under the radar (Although I really don’t care now).  My best friend sometimes says “if I were you I’d just never tell anyone”.  But that’s just more invisible chains and shame.  But it’s kind of funny to me that I had made a career out of invisibility for fear of getting clocked.

My life has absolutely helped put the life of a woman into tech into sharper relief, because I know what most of this industry horseshit is about.  There is no equality, no seeking empathy or cooperation, because that’s just not how most tech bros work.  Even software is some proxy dick measuring contest.  I feel for women who must constantly second guess themselves or wonder if “it’s them”.

I finally got some medically necessary surgery last year.  It was the direct reason I was let go.  

Once, many years ago, I was seriously sexually assaulted by a more senior engineer outside of work.  I reported it and was laid off within a month.  Despite yearly reviews not being due for 8 more months and having no prior negative feedback.

There is no way for me to keep making my salary doing anything else.  I’m not worried about finding work because there is -always- work somewhere.  I know it’s rough now for junior folks, but there is always something.

But I don’t know how to break this mindset?  How do I go back into this world which is so distasteful to my personality?

Has anyone hit this wall before?

I used to dream of making tech that would help heal this world.  I’d be happy just working a normal job in exchange for money like everyone else in the world does.  But this mindset, this feeling, is close to making me want to quit tech for good.

How does everyone else keep their spirits up?",user_893,285,51

What I realized is that launch day isn’t the finish line—it’s the starting point. Sure, it’s important, but expecting it to immediately change everything was setting myself up for disappointment. A startup is a long journey, and success usually comes from the consistent work done before and after launch. It’s about building relationships, nurturing an audience, and improving over time. Launch day is just a tiny, special part of that process.

Looking back, I’m grateful for the lessons that came with setting my expectations straight. It’s made me more focused on the long game and less hung up on one single day.

Nah, if I bring it up now it would be weird because we're talking about something else entirely. Etc.

Problem is, our cto calls it out very often - something like, what do the quieter people think about this, and we sit there in silence, all the pressure on the four quiet people in the room, while I think about what to say until someone else breaks the silence. I'm working on it, trying to speak more in smaller meetings etc to build up to it, but it'll take a while to improve a habit that's followed me since childhood. Anyway, in the meantime, should I bring it up in our one-on-one or something or just not address it?

First post here because while I enjoy reading posts, as a tech PMM lead I have a little hesitation/imposter syndrome about my status as a woman “in tech”. 

I was recently laid off from my VP role at an international tech start up. I’m a little relieved and taking some time to figure out my next move. Some of this has been day dreaming and even documenting some ideas of my own that I’d love to breathe life into and I’ve been eyeing some AI and no-code tools as possibilities. 

In the meantime, I’m seeing so many other talented women, including SWEs, struggling to land their next gig. It made me wonder if there’s an opportunity to matchmake skills, partner on ideas etc. Here’s some ways I think that could look:

- you have an idea, someone else has marketing skills and can provide low or no cost advice for getting something in front of the right audience, message refinement, etc. 
- pitch fest: host zooms where people with ideas pitch their project and state the skills they need and people can opt in on whatever terms they agree on. 
- you have skills to teach. Know the basics of how to get a “vibe coding” project started. Host a zoom demo or AMA and attendees can venmo you $5.  

Something else entirely? Just trying to think of ways to direct the tremendous talents of those not currently in the workforce, foster community, and maybe even a few people create their next gig together (or at least side project). 

If it’s of interest I can kick something off. Would love to hear other ideas too!

I’ve been reading this sub a lot and I wanted to hopefully get some advice/perspectives. I am woman fairly new to tech, and I’ve had some frustrating experiences that are making me question if I’m the problem or if this is just how corporate life is. I’d love advice from other women in tech who’ve been here longer. I’m in sales but really would like advice from women in this space, so I hope you’ll have me! 

I’m 28, a married lesbian, and worked in the service industry for nearly a decade before transitioning into tech sales. I didn’t have much help and put myself thru university and didn’t graduate till I was 25. I started at a SaaS company where I did well, but faced age-related comments from younger coworkers (it was a job meant for fresh grads to start in tech sales, but I needed to get my foot in the door), despite that I honestly loved it until they introduced sudden process changes that really hurt my progress and made it so I had to start over. I was also making $50k base and had moved to a very large US city, so with COL and debt from low wage jobs, it wasn’t sustainable. I did enjoy my coworkers and we got along despite them being awkward about me being 4 years older than them (is it really that much of a difference?!). Wanting better pay and growth, I took a startup role, which I knew was risky, but it has a $75k base. They were dishonest about how organized they were and I had no manager, no training, and was isolated by my all-male team, who made no efforts to hide the isolation. I can go into more detail but trying to keep this short. I reached out to a former female colleague that left right before I started to ask her experience, and she confirmed the culture was exclusionary and she couldn’t take it and left. Also a senior woman at the company confided in me that she felt the same, and cried in my arms (literally) at an onsite meeting about how she feels the company treats her bad for being a woman. I left and took a consulting role, thinking it’d be better, but now I’ve realized much of my job involves acting as an executive assistant for the CEO, not what I signed up for. I’m so disappointed because I asked hard, borderline awkward questions to try to vet this place to make sure I would be happy, and they weren’t honest. I found out they were trying to fill the role for a long time with no luck, so it seems they told me what I wanted to hear. It’s the same salary, $75k.

I’m grateful to have leveled up financially, but I feel stuck. My goal has always been to go from BDR to AE, but I keep ending up in bad situations, being excluded, misled, or stuck in roles that weren’t what I was promised. Is this just how it is? Or can I actually find a place where I can thrive?

Would love to hear from women who’ve been in tech longer, does it get better? I know I have to stay in this role for a bit to be taken seriously for the next role, but feeling utterly stuck and like I messed up my progress now. 

💙 Thanks for letting me in your space despite being in sales.

TL;DR: I keep facing exclusion and misleading job expectations in my tech sales roles. Is this just corporate life, or can I find a place where I actually fit?

It's just all superficial and transactional.

Personally, I'm seeing more people turning to personal microsites on Squarespace / Framer, uploading video resumes on YouTube, and finding that these methods actually help them stand out and land more interviews while forming meaningful connections.

So with both in mind, I’ve created [Openspot](http://heyopenspot.com) (completely free). It's a modern take on LinkedIn, focused on meaningful interactions and presentation of yourself using what works —  meaningful prompts, video, audio, and proof of your work. No endless feeds. No humblebrags. Just real people open to new opportunities and networking. Your profile practically doubles as a portfolio / personal microsite.

There's already a few employers onboarded, so recruiters can reach out to you directly. But you can also connect with other users and network :) Some really important principles that I prioritized building Openspot:

* **No feed, no likes, no endless scrolling.** There’s no pressure to post constantly or play the engagement game.
* **It’s about meaningful discovery and interactions, not vanity metrics.** It's designed for people who want to showcase their real skills, personality and work dynamically. And, I've made it super easy, so you don't have to be a personal branding expert.
* **No algorithm.** You don’t need followers or a content strategy. Instead, you have a profile that actually represents you—through work samples, short video intros, demos, or even just a few well-thought-out lines about what you do best. You can be loud or quiet, interact daily or whenever you want to, or just let your work speak for itself. No penalizing because you're using it for what you actually need.

It's super early and only launched a few weeks ago, but I’d love your thoughts. Does this resonate with you? I'd really appreciate any feedback. Cheers!!",user_929,185,51

I was really excited to kick off my channel, but looking at the analytics data is making me a little sad that I'm not really getting women as part of my audience. My channel viewership is 99.9% male.

I loved programming, got my first job in tech, and I gradually started to hate this environment. At first, I was excited that finally I would be contributing to a real project. But here’s what I found instead.

Toxic tech bros. Ugly, obnoxious men with bloated egos and little self-awareness or culture. They were educated men, with a lot of experience working in innovative technologies, but their culture and communication style was on the level of uneducated chavs the type of construction workers who whistle at women, tell sexist jokes, and drink alcohol.

I was treated as less intelligent; my opinions weren’t taken into account. I would speak, but none of them would acknowledge my opinions. They purposely ignored me because they were a group of tech bros who had consciously classified women as being in a servant role.

I have never witnessed such a concentration of such disgusting characters in my life. And these men had wives and kids. I stalked to see who their wives were, and they were uneducated women, not very pretty, but the main thing that connected their wives together was that they were less educated than their tech bro husbands. I presumed their wives were with them because they earn quite a lot of money and were somehow impressed by their lack of culture and boorish behavior. But no reasonable woman would accept these tech bros. They are not attractive, and their looks are the least of it the main issue is their disgusting, egocentric character.

Very low culture is the biggest part of this environment. The level of entitlement, and the fact that they think they’re smart just because they fixed some bug, is astonishing. Every single one of them thinks they’re special, like Elon Musk. They think they work in tech, so they’re smart because they optimized an algorithm by one second, and they think of themselves like they are geniuses. But in reality, they’re doing a bullshit job.

I used to love programming, but thanks to knowing that tech bros are so common in tech, I feel anxiety working and encountering them on the job. My biggest worry when I look for a new job is whether the team will be full of these disgusting tech bros. I’m at the point where if I joined a team composed of these entitled tech bros from day one, I would resign straight away because I don’t have the energy or mental health to deal with their toxicity. The worst part is that nobody reacts. HR isn’t reacting. I’m the problem for them. I reported tech bros a few times at my job, but I was the problem for them. It’s a fight of 1 vs. 10 tech bros. Nobody will side with you, no matter how accurate you are, because the reality for them is this entitlement, obnoxiousness, low culture, lack of awareness, lack of kindness, and empathy.",user_774,684,98

Reading this sub has really validated my feelings and  experience. <Rant>I was denied a promotion I'd been told I deserved, because I don't ""have enough technical experience."" After being told by manager, boss, and boss' boss that I deserved the job when the budget opened up. After being denied, I quiet quit. I estimated I had done the work of about 2-3 extra people for 8 months, so I dialed back and did the work of half a person for almost 24 months (long enough to get my 401k match vested) before leaving.</Rant>


I am so disheartened by the idea of learning coding languages and getting a BS in something so I can get a better paying job (maybe SDET or something like that?). I really like working with technology.

In one of the jobs I knew the odds were stacked against me. I ended up getting a rejection Wednesday morning saying I didn't show enough interest in the company and I didn't go into too much detail to what I did at my last jobs.  That was a fair critique and I am actually glad that someone gave me feedback after 16 months.

Today I was supposed to hear from the second job. This job I really wanted. I loved the company and I was literally dreaming about moving across the country for this job and starting a new life in the new city. 

This message was sent to me in response to my thank you email: ""it was great speaking with you! You'll be hearing more from us on Friday hopefully""

Today I made a special effort to monitor my phone and email. I waited all day jumping at every email or phone call hoping it was them with some good news that I had gotten the job. It never came. No news ever came by 4:45 PST I knew I wasn't going to hear anything today. 

I was crushed and got in my car to go get a snack and just sat in the parking lot and cried. I have been struggling for so long and I thought it was finally my turn to get the offer that gets me back on track, but no. No, it wasn't. 

I am not only heartbroken that I have to keep struggling and fighting for a job that I know damn well I can do but it also means I have to go back to my hell on earth job at the gas station. I thought I was finally going to get to quit that horrible job! NOPE! the universe wants to keep torturing me even more. I thought it was done torturing me with what happened last Monday! ( you can read about what happened in my post in r/retailhell).  I am still very traumatized by that and now I have to go back on Sunday. 

I know there is still a small chance I could still be given the offer but it wasn't enough to save me from having to back to my hell this Sunday. Also if they didn't contact me today with the offer, odds are they are probably giving the offer of a JUNIOR software dev to a mid or senior due to the messed up market or someone local. But that's just me making speculations because it has happened to me so many times. I don't blame them but it just hurts and stings. I worked so hard to get this far and I always get shot down because of something I can't control.

Honestly, I am tired of all the nos and I just want one yes. I shouldn't have to wait almost two years to get my yes. The human psyche is not designed to take this much rejection. I am just tired mentally and physically and I want to cry again.

Update: Just got the email. They rejected me and gave me the bullshit line about more aligned experience. I am currently crying my eyes out on the bathroom floor. I have had enough and I can not go back to that stupid gas station.

Now, I start to think (maybe overthinking), if I am pivoting, is it still be relevant in the next 10 years? I think I should choose the most right path this year.

FYI, my skill sets are not just in tech. I also can do things like singing and drawing.

Interviewed with a great company, had a great technical discussion with my would-be boss, only for him to suggest that I would be suited at a slightly lower level position/pay, but would still have the same responsibilities...","Basically what the title says. I applied for a company that has great reviews online as a great place to work, has great benefits, work culture, competitive pay, flexible hours, fully remote, etc. It's for a cybersecurity engineer position. For some background, I have a lot of really strong experience with several big-name companies and feel confident in my ability to do just about anything thrown at me. I've fully enjoyed talking with everyone involved in the interviews and had a great feeling about the whole thing. I had my semi-final interview with my would-be boss today and it was a really great discussion. We spoke technical the entire time and filled up the whole hour. Even bounced ideas off of each other and overall had great rapport. 

So I was rather surprised when I got the email today saying that they'd love to move me to the final stages of the interview process, however the recruiter said that my would-be boss had great feedback and that he really likes me, BUT I would be better at a level or two below what was advertised and the compensation would be less as well. From the original range given, the top is like $20k less and if it went down another level, it would be $40k less. It doesn't make any sense... you like me and want me for the job you posted, but you just want to pay me less? And he didn't even disclose the exact reason in the email. I would partially understand if he was like it's because X, Y, Z, etc, but it was just like ""he thinks you would be better at a lower level."" But the same job responsibilities! The pay, even at a level down, would be a general increase from what I'm making now so that would still be good, but the level switcheroo just feels a little... insulting?

It just kind of took the wind out of my sails. I was really excited and now I'm just a little bummed out and questioning whether to go forward with it, even if it is still a pay bump. But then the guilt comes in because a lot of people would still jump at the opportunity and here I am with a bruised ego thinking of turning it down. Has anyone else experienced this and if so, how did you navigate it? Just looking for some general advice and different perspectives. I'm going to take the weekend to mull everything over and then let him know on Monday if I'm still interested. Thanks in advance.",user_1018,93,30

That’s a bit of a stretch because while we did get equity, any of us that joined after 2021 got significantly less and I also make well under $100k a year for that same reason (in the spirit of “we’re all gonna make so much money off this equity”). 

Are there other private tech companies out there that do offer a 401k match?

I was put on a PIP last July and elected to take the money and run. It was my dream job at my dream company so I was fucked up over it all and had to take the whole rest of the year to feel like I was worthy of being an employable software engineer again. I also decided to change domains from back end to iOS development, part of the reason being that part of why I was laid off was because I was re-org'd into being an iOS developer at my last job and my performance issues came from not being able to adjust quickly enough in an entirely new domain.

Ironically (?) I actually like the work of I have, you know, space and time and support in learning it. So I'm making the switch. What sucks for me is that most all jobs available are senior roles. On paper I have 8 years of professional experience, but really only 1 year of iOS experience. I have experience from the vast amounts of self education I've been doing lately to prep for interviews and have some things to show on my GitHub, but of course that doesn't compare to work done in a professional environment.

I have been so incredibly fortunate to get a decent amount of technical screens in spite of this, and I've essentially failed them all except for two. 1 on rescinded this morning because the company wants to try filling the role internally first (sucks but makes sense). The other is for a company I'm not that excited about but would also require me moving and/or getting a car, two things I really don't want to do. Out of an abundance of caution and warnings from others about the lack of opportunities, I applied to jobs all throughout the Bay Area, but in actuality I would prefer something that I can commute to within an hour id I must be in office which rules out all of South Bay. I even asked the recruiter this morning if they have shuttle service but they shut it down recently because barely anyone in the company used it.

In addition, studying for my technical screens has been an impossible task. With backend, you can honestly leetcode your way to success. With iOS, my screens have been so different from each other. I just have to try to know as much as possible and pray that I was exposed to the subject matter before the call or I'll fail miserably (as I have for the past 2 weeks).

Obviously I'm going to give this incoming onsite my all and I still have some technical screens coming up sporadically in the next 2 weeks so I'll keep it up studying wise but I feel so demoralized.

I’m a woman in tech, and I’m navigating a unique set of challenges in both my professional and personal life. My husband and I have a non-traditional setup—he takes care of home chores and cooking while also working, and I’m the one driving the strategic planning and dreaming big for our future. However, despite the support in some areas, I often feel a subtle resistance from him regarding my ambition and career growth.

For context, I’ve recently started making more noise at work—asking for impactful projects, taking ownership, and pushing for my ideas. I believe in the mindset that “winning comes to those who ask,” and I’m determined to break through the barriers that society often places on women in the workplace. Yet, when I share these efforts with my husband, he often downplays or encourages me to wait and be patient, advising me to accept the politics in tech instead of pushing against them. This advice feels at odds with my mindset and can leave me feeling unsupported, especially when I’m trying to make bold moves to advance in my career.

I’ve even brought up the fact that my mindset is that asking and advocating for myself is key to growth—just like many successful people do—and yet when I try to talk about these ambitions, his response is often a subtle reminder to play it safe. He never acknowledges the value I bring to our home or the effort I put into growing professionally, and when I confront him, the conversation feels more about him needing space rather than truly recognizing my drive and vision.

I’m also grappling with this feeling that, while I can discuss these challenges with him, it feels like there’s a bit of jealousy or reluctance to see me succeed in a way that might outshine him. It creates a cycle where I feel both unsupported and slightly belittled when I’m actively trying to push forward, not just for my career, but for us as a family.

I’m looking for advice from other women in tech who have dealt with similar dynamics—especially the tension between personal growth and partner dynamics. How do you stay true to your ambitions when there’s resistance at home? How do you balance supporting your career while maintaining healthy communication with your partner? I’m also interested in hearing how you’ve managed to advocate for yourself at work, especially when faced with the politics and biases that women often encounter.

Any advice, resources, or stories would be much appreciated.

Edit_1: Thank you for sharing your experiences. The women here truly inspire me. As pointed out by many, I will start career coaching, journaling and probably outsourcing my admin needs like cleaning/ cooking. I now realize how normal it is for other growth mindset women to feel like this from their SO. I intend to not pour more energy trying to have them acknowledge my hardships/ value. Instead I plan to grow into a person where I stop relying on them for this coz why should I have to",user_557,17,43

Got PIP,"Last yr in was moved to a mainframe project which I had no clue about apparently in a PO capacity which nobody clearly told me about. I tried my best and when right after 3weeks of being in the most hostile group I stared telling my manager to move me out of it, he didn't. I failed and I own up to my failures. Mid ur review was a crap show and I swallowed my pride very humbly , put my emotions aside and had a 1-1 with 2nd above. I explained him with data and fact and I was treated like garbage on that call. Tho I was moved in another group, I thrived. I nailed every single crap thrown at me. I am spearheaded that project to it's final release next month. 
My 2024 yrly performance was fkd to say the least. 

Today in my 1-1 with the manager he very gently handed me an 'informal warning' with soo many contradictions i.e - she doesn't know Java and followed it with verbal explanation of because i didn't let you , I moved you in another project for a different role. You never had the time to learn. So I said then why is it reflected as my fault? Verbatim is failing me. He said to put all the details in my reply. Then kept repeating that I need to start my reply with 'I (as in me) obediently acknowledge what my manager has mentioned. However...' then add my remarks. 
I have a major heartburn right now. First, you failed to help me. Then I failed myself. Then you threw a rock on my to completely drown me and now it all is my fault. All because the project I failed at , the manager is in great books with all the aboves and I found lots and lots of process failures, audit discrepancies and more compliance issues which I did raise and she landed in hot water. She had effectively shut me out after that. The politics is what I lost at, not work. 
Options I'm considering - hr or go 3 above him and talk . Yes, I am already looking for 2 months and there's nothing out there. I don't and won't rage quit. I also have all our 1-1s recorded on my cell. They've been shuttling me for 2yrs. Hiring for the role I'm in is offshore to India. Me and 2 more are under PIP with the same title. Idk I'm just very incredibly salty right now. Will cool off and decide. Husband says go straight to hr and if they let you go then o well. We'll figure it out. Have about 6 months saved up. 
What would you do about this messy situation. I'm an expirienced PM-BA-SM-QA manager. he's told me today to learn coding. He also admitted to not letting me be stable in any team because they needed my very diverse skills everywhere else. ",user_1319,54,21

Based on my previous experience, so many job descriptions feel like just smoke and mirrors which gives me a feeling of disillusionment.

I am considering a PhD but knowing that I will be in the same position where I am now after 3 or 4 years later but I will be even older... I am not sure if I should keep going. I am based in the UK. Knowing that the UK does not have many big tech companies, I am not sure it would be worth the money and effort. I have a child so I feel like the money should be spent on him rather than me. At the same time, does that mean I am not good at what I do? Should I just give up everything and wait for death? 
Honestly, I am kinda tired of the tech industry that is so ageist, sexist, classist and racist. I really hope my child becomes a doctor or something.

This is a post for early career.

I am someone who was able to do it in a short time in FAANG. I am a senior swe but have significant support from my manager, director, other directors and 2 VPs in my career to progress higher. I would count them as my mentors more than my leadership. I get included in a lot of events and training specifically for people who show promise in leadership as well.

How did I do it? I’ll leave some bullet points
1. Dressing well and being put together - I notice a lot of women in engineering seem to dress the same as their male counterparts. This is a mistake because we are unfortunately held to a higher standard. Sometimes I do dress down but never when I have meetings with anyone above me.
2. Getting the support of your coworkers. You need to figure out which coworkers are your advocates early and develop both working and personal relationships with them. This is easier to do early on. I would set up a 1:1 weekly meeting with them, the first meeting get to know them, subsequent meetings spend 5 mins asking about their day or life then jump into technical questions. At the same time be independent enough you don’t need much hand holding and don’t impede their work.
3. You have to be lucky with a good manager. My first manager worked in faang for 15 years and told me privately I was the best employee he’s ever had. He even wrote it on a recommendation letter when I applied for a masters. I had a weekly meeting for him and without prompting I told him everything I accomplished and anything I needed. I also asked questions about his background and what he works on. He was my greatest champion and went above and beyond for my promo.
4. Have a bi-monthly or monthly meeting with your manager’s skip. And also director if you can swing it. First meeting you should tell them the story of your life, get them invested in you, ask them theirs. Next meetings cheerfully tell them what a great team they put together and what you accomplished with them (should be something with actual impact). Invite them to presentations of your work even if they don’t come. Never go in negative.
5. Go to those virtual events designed for women and go to in person after work events. Go to other tech events in your city. At these events I was able to connect with directors, VPs and other leadership. Don’t go in hungry, be personable and wait for them to give you their contact. Go to other events in your city as other people you connect with will know people at your company. I met a very important director in my org by messaging her one of her former rockstar employees told me I should have a sit down with her some time. She ended up recommending me to another director of a team I wanted to get on after one convo. Impress them, know your audience and how to package information to make you look competent and know how to drive impact. This is easier to do the lower the level you are as people love underdogs and are more willing to give you leeway.
6. Pick a mentor who seems the most willing to help other women with the most power. I connected with a VP in a different org through a mentorship group. I developed a relationship with her for many months, focusing on the positives of my career and company. When a promo of mine got arbitrarily blocked she stepped in for me above and beyond her station to get it unblocked. My manager was so impressed when this VP contacted him on my behalf that he privately asked me how I was able to get people to like and support me this much. I told him that you have to be presentable, likeable and an underdog. People want to help promising young women.
7. Understand what you’re getting into. You need the drive and the energy to maintain these relationships for months and years and never take it personally if someone gives you the brush off. Even the most stereotypical male engineers who you would never expect to support you can be brought to your side. One of them even cried when I left my team because of how thankful I told him I was of his support. On the flip side, my mentors shared what they went through as a women in FAANG leadership, though I won’t share their particular stories, it is truly backhanded and horrible.

No accountability unless you have raised the mirror and spoken truth to power, then you are told ""you are not meeting performance expectations"". Gaslit and pushed to the brink - this book brings it all back up. Men don't have it great either to tell you the truth. 

Something I had to look past: really dunking Sheryl, although I'm sure she was a monster - she was obviously the first adult in the room at FB. She made it better, but unfortunately she was no better than any of the other execs. Good for her on getting the F outta there, but she took any sense of equality with her.

I haven't worked at other FAANGs, are they all like this? Wielding power without thinking, disrupting for a sense of importance, taking without thinking about the consequences?

I am a 31yo automotive engineer with over a decade in the industry. I have an incredibly strong background in vehicle development and suspension, and I have worked for major OEMs my whole career.

Fast forward to 2025... I'm noticing a very concerning shift in the job market, and finding that I am receiving job rejections almost instantaneously. I have never in my 12 years experienced this quick rejection, and for jobs that I am arguably overqualified for in the first place.

I've been thinking about what this means and wondering if there's a correlation between my
""motherhood"" age [albeit I am childless] and the realities of the DEl status. I can't help but wonder if I am getting written off early because of this and if other women are experiencing the same. No one's talking about it on LinkedIn, but I feel like this cannot be a coincidence. I have probably been rejected by a total of 10-12 different companies within the first few days of my application, and in no way did they even have time to read my resume at that rate.

Over the last couple weeks I’ve had a repeat “viewer” from a firm on LinkedIn.

Then a couple weeks ago, that firm’s recruiter contacted via LinkedIn message. I explained that I wasn’t currently looking and my nonnegotiable reasons, thanked them for their time and thanked them for thinking of me, goodbye (via the LinkedIn messaging/mail).

Two days later they sent the same message on the app. I copy/pasted my response and assumed they were just scattered/spamming and forgetful. They responded “could I please help them find someone?”. I ignored, I don’t know anyone looking.

Then today the same recruiter has now called my personal phone and emailed my personal email. My personal email is available to 1st level connections on LinkedIn, my phone # is not (altho it comes up in a Google Search).

This is getting a bit weird, right?

And FWIW, I am not working in a high demand industry, do not have particularly unique or stellar qualifications, etc. There are thousands of others with similar. Any other recruiter I’ve talked to has accepted the first decline, but it’s rare to even hear from them. Sample size small.

Guess #1 is that *absolutely no one is willing to jump jobs* due in part due to instability due to current economic and political uncertainties.

Guess #2 this guy is just weird.

So, according to LinkedIn, i’d be in my late 20s or early 30s today. By some miracle of the goddesses I have genetics that also make me appear in that age range. (I’m in my mid-40s)

In my past few interviews, my interviewer has made some comments about their children and my knee-jerk reaction is to empathize because I love talking about kids and want to find common ground, but I find myself fighting that instinct really hard to pass the illusion that I’m a young, unmarried woman in the hopes that it’ll increase my chances of being hired. This makes me feel sad and that I’m not really being my authentic self. But I’m so afraid of all the discriminations that are prevalent towards middle-aged, married women with kids in the corporate world.

What are your thoughts on this?

ETA: The reason I remove my wedding ring is because I was advised early on in my career that employers perceive married women as a liability because they either have or will have children, therefore not being able prioritize and dedicate more time towards work.

This happened a couple of weeks ago, but it’s really stuck with me and I thought this would be the right place to post about it. 

I’m in a 2-year apprenticeship program where you intern in IT four days a week while getting your Associates full time. The program is designed for people who don’t have a tech background but want to enter the field. My chosen path is Programming and I’ve been interning in Software Development for about 4/5 months now. I’m the only woman on the team. 

I’ve been enjoying it A LOT. It’s a lot of work and challenging, but I find it goes well with how my brain works. I’ve been wanting to get into tech professionally for a long time. I’ve done web dev as a hobby since I was a kid and taken courses, and have been able to use those skills sometimes in my previous career path. So this is like a dream opportunity for me. 

Everyone has to set goals this month, so I met with my manager about mine. He asked me what my goals were and what kind of programming I saw myself doing. I told him that I loved what I was doing and that even though it was early, I’d be really interested in creating a path to become a Junior Developer. (One of my team members graduated from the same program and just got promoted from Junior to (Regular) Developer.)

He then said that he didn’t get the sense that I’m a “code nerd,” and that coding is something I like to play around with but am not passionate about, and that there are other forms of programming where you don’t have to constantly keep yourself updated, like COBOL. When I told him that I disagreed with that perception of myself, he brought up an idea I had for personal coding project I’ve been wanting to work on and said that instead of just thinking about it, a code nerd would’ve already made it. I tried to explain that I hadn’t yet made it not out of a lack of interest, but because I don’t have a lot of free time in this program. 

I was super upset after the meeting and felt defeated. Of course I’m passionate about programming! Why would I be working four days a week for little pay (because it’s an internship) while spending money to get a second degree (which is another 15 - 20 hours of work a week) if I weren’t passionate about this? I might not be coding every waking hour of my life but that doesn’t mean I don’t love what I’m doing and take it seriously. My coworker who did the same program said that HE doesn’t even spend his free time coding.

I’m still really struggling with the fact that my manager said this, especially given that I’ve gotten good feedback from my team members. I understand the importance of learning outside of work and building a portfolio, but this just felt hurtful. Being new to the field, using a new language, and working among senior developers is already enough of a challenge without having something like this added on top of it. Pursuing a career in programming has been a dream goal of mine for a long while, and now I just feel deflated. ",user_1337,58,29

I've been working for that company for over 4 years now. I have Master degree, skills, experience, I know the solution, the people and I even speak all the 4 languages that are spoken in the company. 

They already skipped me for a different role promotion last year, this year my team lead told me about a new opening and that I should send my CV directly to the CTO for the internal hiring, he thought I would be a perfect fit. I did, and the CTO called me back, talking about some ""possible obstacles"", like the need of working on site and all that kind of bullsht. (I've been working for them remotely but I was also traveling to their sites whenever it was needed.)

Then he pulled out that decision is not up to him but it's the CEO who picks the candidate for this role and he would forward him my CV.

Well guess what, I found out that they have been interviewing other candidates and they never got back to me. Now I wonder whether he even forwarded him my CV.

For me this is an equivalent of ""not technical enough, although not explicitly said. Believing they would find someone better for the role is just ridiculous. I was thinking, maybe they just want to be sure and have an interview with candidates from outside first, but honestly, why would they do it, if they thought I was good enough for this role.

But as I settled into the job I realized a couple things: the first thing is, I was estimating the amount of money I would make based on 40 hours a week for the duration of the contract but in reality with time off, holidays, not enough work, etc I am just not making the money that I thought would to justify taking time off between contracts for postpartum. 

The second thing is the amount of time and energy I’ve had to spend on top of doing the work, just to prove my productivity and how available the other contractors on my team were after hours to “step in” and keep up good standing with the client and I realized how little I would care to do that if I was pregnant/postpartum/caring for little ones. I also carry probably a bit more anxiety than I should about submitting my hours every week and I feel the need to justify or work late into the night to make sure I’m producing work that can be cited while they review my timesheets and I worry that would cause even more anxiety if doing pregnancy and postpartum hormones. I find myself lately looking at full time jobs again, ready to take the pay cut in order to have more protections and a paid leave, even if it might be shorter than I would like. 

I can’t help but long for someone to look up to in all this, so I’m reaching out here. Anyone else out there working as an independent contractor? Maybe in the same boat a me or someone who is doing this type of work after kids? I’d love any advice this community has for someone staring down the barrel of being a working mother in a male dominated industry. ",user_1342,10,2

I took the job as a lateral so that I may get the experience in an area I was lacking. My performance reviews have been excellent and I’ve mended fences with some our clients who hate working with my boss. For additional background he is sexist. I say that because of comments he’s said around me about women taking maternity leave. He also frequently says that women are too emotional yet most of our personnel issues have been with men. IDK were to go from here. I had a feeling he was going to go with the safe bet because the other candidate is a man and isn’t a threat to him. He also admitted he is pigeonhole me in my current position until we can find someone to take my job. No one wants it because I have the same responsibility as the job I was applying for but without the pay or title. He also admitted I was more prepared and my experience was more relevant but tried to walk it back when I pointed out his contradicted statements. So now I’ll have to train this person because they have no experience in my area. Top it off he’ll announce today in front of our mgmt. Team. Many of the mgmt. team encouraged me to apply and felt it was a layup since I was already doing the work. Also he put one of my subordinate on the panel which I’ve never had before.

I’m not even sure where to begin with this post. I was class of 2022, studied computer science, and was *incredibly* lucky to have gotten a job at one of the top tech companies straight out of college. I’ve been working now for almost 2.5 years in this same position.

There is so much backstory to this. When I started working, it was during COVID lockdown and there was a massive hiring freeze. The first 9 months of my employment looked like this: my team consisted of myself & my manager (who had never been a manager before), i had no mentor, no team to learn from, and i had the barriers of working in lockdown without any sense of community at work. 

To make matters worse, I had undiagnosed ADHD, so I struggled constantly with executive disfunction and daily burnout. This made me feel stupid every single day & like I’m not cut out for this industry. Worse, it was *not* in my head, I actually did get feedback about needing to improve my turnaround time. I got on ADHD meds eventually, which helped, but I’ve always felt like this unmedicated period of time had followed me and painted me as someone who isn’t “quite good enough”.

We’ve since hired 2 more people onto our team, but they are both men. So even after 2.5 years I have always been the youngest AND the only woman AND I just feel like I’m always the least capable person (or at least I feel like that’s how I’m seen). 

It doesn’t help that I was denied a promotion due to “budget cuts” (mind you I haven’t been promoted at all in 2.5 years) AND now there have been rumors going around that the company is moving to a more “aggressive” and “performance based” culture & that they are going to start firing people, giving PIPs, and doing layoffs. So, now I’m anxious that I am on the chopping block because I’m the youngest, only woman, and at the beginning of my career I was not always “up to par”. 

… On the other side of it, I can’t help myself from daydreaming about being laid off, taking the severance, moving out of this country, and doing literally anything else. I feel like this job and the manner in which it started (no team, no women, no support, no nothing) has put such a bad taste in my mouth. Every single day is an uphill battle to try to force myself to get work done. I don’t know how much longer I can take it. 

Trouble is, I cannot lose this job. I can’t afford to be fired or laid off. And with the current job market, I doubt I would be able to find another job if I did. I just can’t get these thoughts out of my head, and I feel selfish for it, because I know I’m lucky to have a job right now in the first place— so many people are posting every day about not being able to get hired. It’s just so hard.",user_1345,59,14

I have been at my current job for 4 years, it is a tiny tech startup, and my team has two software devs, me and my manager. For such a small startup it has pretty good wlb, where some weeks I barely work because there are no urgent deadlines, and rarely did I have to work nights. It is fully remote too.

We recently did some slight reorg where I took charge of this third party Saas software that needs constant maintenance and management because of the way we use it. I was very hesitant at the beginning because its not very technical, but I wanted to be a team player, so I agreed in the end, because my manager had other new work pushed onto her when she got promoted from dev to manager. I was hesitant because I did not want it to be my entire work. One month later, it is all I work on. I have to maintain it constantly, and with some more overtime since I have more meetings.

Basically it is not a high value skill that would make me marketable when looking for a new job, nor are the maintenance tasks transferable to other tech industries, its quite niche.

Here are other quick other things
- with 4 years of experience and at the company, I feel like I am being underpaid ($110k, but at least its a 6-figure paycheck)
- 2 weeks of pto (better than no pto I guess)
- You need to ask for a raise, or else you don’t get one (at least they are 5% raises each time I ask for them)
- no 401k or HSA matching (but at least there is the option for having those accounts, because we didn’t have 401k the first 2 years I was there)
- never been promoted (but I didn’t mind as long as I got my requested annual raises)

I’m grateful I don’t have any toxic coworkers or intense stress. I am just comfortable if not bored. Because I am remote and how the team culture is like, I have no one to really talk casually with or rant to (or maybe a good idea I don’t have any close coworkers).

I know I should look for a new job, and I have been, I cannot for my life perform well on technical interviews, which takes time and practice. An idea dawned upon me: what if I quit my job and did interview prep as if it is my full time job? 

Issue is that the job market is not great, and I do not know how long it will take before I find the next job.

Haha if you made this far thank you for reading. I am seeking words of encouragements and advice on what I should do. Or maybe my job isn’t that bad. Please let me know :)

while not intentional, shortly after starting my job I lost a family member and ended up pretty well situated on the anti-work train. obviously I was grieving for several years. my performance wasn't great, and my social anxiety I guess made me appear ""extra friendly"" to people.

so I ended up in a position where I was working hard but my output was not great, and I think people's expectations adjusted accordingly.

the company itself has been through many transitions, from devastating layoffs, changes in leadership and overall company direction. gotten put on lots of projects that were cancelled or defunded months later. most of my coworkers from this time period have quit or been laid off.

so far I have enjoyed a great deal of flexibility and light workload while being paid well, but I'm still struggling with some aspects 

this year the company is ""cracking down"" on specific metrics, most of which don't apply to my team/me. I've ended up predominantly managing a database system that was abandoned by another worker who was laid off, and running other meetings.

more than that, I'm just exhausted. with everything going on politically I feel dread and anxiety every day. I'm chronically ill, chronically tired and never even make it to work before noon. it's becoming impossible to keep up.

I've been told by everyone around me not to do whatever I have to do not to quit. obviously I don't want to lose my health insurance and other benefits, but each day is harder to muster the energy to keep up. I can't even describe the reason I feel this way, it's so many different things.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How do you bring this up? Did you figure out some kind of medical excuse? Should I tell my boss I've just quit drinking? Am I crazy for not doing better?

After years of working in marketing and user research, I became a software dev about 8 years ago but only recently found myself on what I'd call a true engineering team - 100% back end, infra heavy, nothing user facing, working on what (to me) seem like trivial problems in code that have little connection to business use cases, high level strategy, etc. Team is all men, none of whom have ever worked outside of tech. They all find a lot of enjoyment in this kind of work, I do not, but for various reasons, am stuck with this team for at least 6 months.

I'm really struggling with communication and work style, as there is a tendency for my team to be hyper literal and very down in the details and unable to pull back up to a high level and answer questions / provide context in an organized way. Often when I finally figure out what we're doing for some task, I realize that the problem itself is far, far more straightforward than the (hours long, chaotic) conversation led me to believe. There's been nothing so far that has made me think I have massive gaps in my own technical knowledge or skills, which was my original fear. It really seems like this is about information sharing & processing vs actual knowledge. 

My guess is there's a massive difference in style of education, training, and career history - they've learned to think bottom up, I've learned to think top down. And I get the sense they have not had the same pressure that I have had to ""meet people where they are"" and break ideas down into digestible concepts, but have been rewarded for ""sounding smart"" and getting deeply technical off the bat.

https://economist.com/business/2025/03/06/the-behaviour-that-annoys-colleagues-more-than-any-other
from The Economist

The best suggestion I’ve seen in this sub for dealing with it is graciously: thank the colleague for building on and strengthening your idea: things are achieved by teams after all, rarely by a single individual. 

Thought this article would resonate with many of you. I put the text behind the paywall below: 

Surveys of office behaviour are not scientific. In a global poll conducted last year by Kickresume, a firm that helps create cvs, 85% of people said they had experienced an annoying co-worker. That means the remaining 15% are either sole traders or liars. But surveys can still reveal truths about what gets people riled up. The Kickresume survey put credit-stealing top of the list of irritating colleague behaviour, as did a survey of British workers in 2022 by Perspectus Global, a research firm. Another recent poll, this time of American workers and conducted by BambooHR, crowned taking credit for employees’ ideas as the worst managerial trait of all.

You get the picture. Grabbing kudos for someone else’s idea makes lots of people angry. In fact, it is seen as unacceptable from a very early age: research has shown that children as young as five disapprove of plagiarism. Done intentionally and repeatedly, credit-grabbing is not just annoying but bad for the organisation: ideas are hoarded, trust erodes and motivation suffers. A recent paper by Siyuan Chen of Beijing Jiaotong University and his co-authors found that credit-claiming by executives at a large Chinese manufacturing firm was associated with worse job performance by employees.

When something happens a lot and is extremely irritating, a coping mechanism is needed. So the next time you hear your brilliant idea coming out of the mouth of a colleague, breathe deeply and remember three things.
First, credit-stealing may be less malevolent than imagined. Psychologists have long documented a phenomenon called “cryptomnesia” in which people inadvertently plagiarise the ideas of others. Experiments into cryptomnesia vary but the basic set-up is for participants in a group to be asked to generate ideas to solve a particular problem. They are then told to recall only their own ideas, and to come up with new ideas that do not replicate ones that have already been raised. Despite these instructions, people tend to claim a decent chunk of old ideas as their own, and to copy previous suggestions when raising ostensibly new ideas. People may steal credit without even realising it.

Second, innovation very rarely takes the form of an entirely new idea; instead, it recombines existing ones. And people often reach the same conclusions independently. That is the message of “Like”, an entertaining new book by Martin Reeves and Bob Goodson on the origins of the “like” button. The thumbs-up icon was made ubiquitous when Facebook adopted it in 2009, but well before then firms like Vimeo, Yelp, Digg.com and FriendFeed had been experimenting with ways for users to register an emotional reaction to content. So even if you think of an idea as your own stroke of genius, the reality is likely to be messier.


Third, credit-stealing can backfire. Decent bosses know that success stems from teams of people, not individuals (bad bosses will just appropriate the idea as their own anyway). Work by Eric VanEpps of Vanderbilt University and his co-authors has found that the best way to project both competence and warmth is to mix a bit of bragging and a bit of praise for others. And though expressing pride in achievements, even if they are not your own, can be a good way to communicate an aura of success, it pays not to be too specific.

A paper by Rebecca Schaumberg of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania looks at what happens when people show pride in a performance whose details are known to others. Imagine, for example, two programmers who post identical high scores in a programming competition; one goes on a frenzy of fist-pumping and the other says she is not that proud of how she did. Observers reckon that the buoyant programmer is at the ceiling of her potential, and judge the downbeat one to be more skilled. Overt credit-stealers may appear less, not more, competent.

Ideally, you would not need to reconcile yourself to a bit of credit-stealing. Recognition would simply be doled out accurately. But even when credit has been allocated appropriately, there is another problem. Work by Heather Sarsons of the University of British Columbia and others has shown that male academic economists get tenure regardless of whether they solo-author or co-author papers; women are less likely to get tenure the more they co-author. That suggests biases can still end up distorting recognition when it is not possible to know who contributed most on a team. That really is infuriating.",user_1357,37,6

The org I’m at has had some changes recently that will artificially stunt any further forward progress on a defined management track and I’m coming to terms with the reality that I’ll likely need to look externally, despite being happy with my team and some parts of my current job. 

The parts of my job that I want to part with are hands on build/coding/development work. The parts of my job I’d love to focus more on is team management/people development, cross team enablement, and acting as an engagement manager or success manager on projects. I don’t have formal project manager training but have had to pick up quite a bit of slack there and enjoy some of those functions as well. I haven’t seen many postings in my search that focus so heavily on people leadership, and I’m guessing that’s a blend of typical jobs and the fact that those likely go internal first. 

Curious if anyone has found a way to make a full switch similar to what I’m describing, and what words of wisdom you might offer? Historically I’ve made lateral moves in title for more money and moved up internally that way, but this is my first time trying to move up outside of my current org. Bonus points if you’ve escaped consulting or pro serv and moved internal. 

Appreciate any advice or stories to share!",user_1358,2,0

I have this problem that’s been irritating me for some time. I need to explain my team structure to explain my case. I am part of team A but I work 100% for team B. We say I’m on loan to team B. My manager is in team A although I never work with him for any project. In team B I have no manager, there’s the product owner and director etc who are seniors in that team and they communicate with my manager about my performance and give raises bonuses etc and in my opinion they have been generous with those. Always good feedback etc. 

The problem is I don’t think I’m given same professional development opportunities as people who belong to team B. For example: there’s a junior dev in my team who has single ownership of a project that interacts with business. Another example is there’s an integration architect who works on the design and architecture of projects other than integration. They loop me into these things. But it is more like, we want to keep you in the loop and want your input. But I don’t have ownership of any of these areas even though it fits under my role. 
When I think about it, it seems like they’re developing personnel in their team and I’m like an afterthought who fills in gaps and it is annoying me so much and making me frustrated. I don’t know how to bring it up professionally, anytime I have tried to raise it like oh you didn’t include me in this meeting, the PO will be like oh that’s right, you know what let’s discuss this in the tech leads call and bring you upto speed. Ugh! I’m like oh thank you so much! While hating myself to communicate this effectively. 

Why’s a junior dev in charge of this project and gets his own area and I’m in a supporting role. I don’t get ownership of a project from the very beginning. That’s bugging me a lot. They are very open to communication and they value feedback but I feel like whatever I said above makes me seem petty. Am I jealous or underutilized? Shouldn’t I be happy for making more with less work? Help me please. Does this make sense. Should I just let it go?",user_817,2,6

We are 5 months past a huge layoff for context.  I could sense this guy has had it out for me from the beginning and told my last manager I was afraid to report to this guy.  In our first 1:1 he bragged about being best in his class at some college back in India, and how he won some prize at his last job for being the best engineer they have ever had, lolz. No questions about me at all, just bragging.   There a lot of insecure men like this in tech and I’d never take a job with him if he had been the hiring manager for my role.  I should say I have a PhD from a great school and am a poc woman and he has seemed threatened by me from day 1.

Anyway he put in his notice last week and is leaving the company on Tuesday. Since he put in his notice he has been on some crazy mission to get me fired, and has ramped up the “you’re getting pushed out” rhetoric times 10.  We had agreed on hitting some revenue goal in q1, and I questioned why I’m getting fired when I’m far exceeding this goal? Ive already doubled this goal before end of Q1, but he insists I’m not qualified for the job and not performing at my level. I specifically asked my VP (who I’ll be reporting to next) yesterday whether I was on a PIP and he said no. Today my this outgoing manager told me I should just give up and take an exit package and that he was happy to help me request that from HR for me

I’m so so confused by what the hell this guy is doing. I told manager my VP confirmed I’m not on a PIP yet, and this guy agreed yet is insisting I take a package and leave. 

wtf? Can anyone help me think through why this director wants me gone desperately when he’s leaving in two days?     And how can someone push you out like this when you’re far exceeding the revenue goal?  Shouldn’t I be protected in some way by my meeting the goal for this quarter? ",user_49,171,41

When I was being recruited the woman (outside recruiter) told me off the cuff this is an all male shop. During the interview process I was told I’d be working with the company’s main client, all the contacts there are women and I’ll be interacting with them daily via teams video/chat. At first I was a little nervous about being the only woman because at my current job I’m the only woman on my team (and I’m tired of being their emotional support), but knowing I’ll be talking to other women all day was a relief. 

I’m super excited for this new opportunity but I feel a bit like a kid going to school for the first time? I am unsure about what business casual looks like for women (I’ve been on other sub’s researching)? But more importantly I’m have no experience navigating corporate office culture irl, just virtually from the comfort of my own home.

Recently, I had a interview on Teams… and it went terribly.

I wasn’t expecting technical questions on the spot. They showed me snippets of code and asked me to find logical errors or to write an algorithm to solve a problem. As soon as the live coding started, I felt completely destabilized. I struggled to focus, and every time they said, “One more minute,” my mind went blank. The pressure kept building, and I just couldn’t think straight. There were about 7-8 questions, and I only managed to answer two. I knew some of the concepts, but in the moment, I just couldn’t put my thoughts together. They would ask one question at a time and wait for my answer before moving to the next. I tried to say something, but my mind was completely blank I just couldn’t find anything to say.

I apologized and mentioned that I would have found it easier with pen and paper, but that the stress was making me forget everything. It was frustrating because I know I’m capable, but in a high-pressure, live coding setting, my brain just didn’t cooperate.

I didn’t expect the interview to be like this, and I wasn’t prepared for this kind of technical questioning. Walking away from the interview, I couldn’t help but feel completely incompetent.

I made Director about 4 years ago, with 10 years Product Management beforehand, and my skillset now is kind of niche and specialized, perfect for my role, but not a logical progression for what’s next.   I’m a bit burned out my company but I want to stay put til next March to hit a RSU vest date.  

My company does not promote people if they stay where they are and the annual wage adjustments have not kept up with inflation, so I’m grinding and slowly saving 401k and bonuses, but I don’t really feel like base salary has improved over the course of my career - just barely kept up with inflation.  Why do companies have “best years ever” and work lean so you have to just absorb the surge, but not give decent raises because there might be a downturn in the future?  Rumors are that my company does not reduce force in downturns, but I don’t feel a whole lot of trust with upper level management right now with their RTO push.  

I had my 1st baby about 3 years ago, so it’s been a big life adjustment being a full time working parents.   My company just did an aggressive return to office push, which is just really hard as a toddler mom with a long commute, and it feels like they took away a benefit I needed to maintain work life balance.  A lot to women have been leaving, or sticking around but stressed out since this new policy came into force last month.  I feel like my challenge is unique vs other moms of young kids in daycare only because of my long commute and level of visibility.  

I want better work life but other Director roles seem like they require a lot more overtime than mine.  I also don’t want my resume to read manager - director - manager, like I couldn’t hang.  Am I right that would look bad or am I overthinking?  

Looking for a little perspective.  I don’t feel like I should complain relative to others situations, but I’m just exhausted.  Do I just hang in exactly where I am and keep my head down - do my best to rest and vest and maybe even care a little less?

If I can hit my vest date I’ll have enough RSU vested I could leave the company and transition to consulting.  This seems like the best plan to manage a better work life balance but keep my title progression looking ok on my resume in case I want to really get back to focusing on my career once the kiddo is a little older.  

Or maybe my company’s RTO is making it hard to consider next steps.  I want to stay long enough to vest my most valuable RSU batch by next March, and I’m not sure when I should shift to looking externally.  Internal job search is just bumming me out right now because nothing feels like a better bet than my current role.  Recession fears and market uncertainty make it harder.  

Bottom line I’m stressed and even considering a mental health FMLA - my doctor said since I have GAD he could recommend I need a 4 days a week schedule to go to counseling and manage my mental health condition.  They wouldn’t be allowed to reduce my title if I did that to ride out the next 12 months in a sane way with better quality of life, could they?  

Am I overthinking the impact of losing my Director title is a go part time or take a different role?  Probably yes, knowing myself.  I’m just trying to figure out what to do.  Anyone else been here before?  ",user_1364,6,12

I woke up, got dressed, did my makeup, and made sure my hair looked nice. I spent the morning watching TV and researching the company. At 12:30, I left my place for the 16-minute drive downtown to the capital city. I parked at 12:50, but here’s where I made my first mistake: I got lost walking around the city. Even though the building was close to where I parked, I arrived 8 minutes late. Lesson learned—I should have left earlier.

The day consisted of three interviews. The first person met me in the lobby, and I apologized for being late, explaining that I wasn’t used to navigating a city. The interview itself seemed fine, but I couldn’t tell if they liked me or not (I’m usually terrible at reading these things unless it’s really obvious).

The second interview is where things went downhill. I hadn’t eaten in over 12 hours, and about 10 minutes in, I started seeing dark spots in my vision. I tried to power through and answer their questions, but I realized halfway through that I was only making eye contact with one interviewer, even when the other was speaking. I consciously corrected this, trying to make eye contact with whoever was talking. One of them had an accent, and I was worried I might come off as rude or inattentive because of the vision issues, which was absolutely not my intention. Also, I kind of fumbled on one question. They asked how I know when it’s time to ask for help, and I said something like, “When I’m getting irritated with the code or if it’s been over three hours.” Not my best wording.

After that, I had a short break before the third interview. I texted my mentor about how it was going, and they sent me an encouraging “do your best” message. I knew the day wasn’t going perfectly, but it wasn’t a total disaster, either. The third interview was done via video on a big TV because the interviewer was home sick (the office has a hybrid setup, and Thursdays are office days). This one felt like it went better. I did have a small slip where I might’ve asked a question too aggressively, but they reminded me that I could ask anything, so I softened my tone and rephrased. Overall, I enjoyed talking to this person and even said I hoped we’d get to work together. Thankfully, no dark spots during this one!

At the end, Interviewer #1 came back to ask if I had any final questions. I couldn’t think of anything major, so they walked me back to the elevator. As soon as I stepped outside, I realized I’d forgotten my jacket. I went back, explained the situation to the security guard, and they let me up to grab it. I even snagged a fun-size bag of Skittles from the candy drawer on my way out. 

Lessons learned from this experience:  

1. Always eat something before an interview, even if it’s just a piece of toast.  

2. If the interview is in an unfamiliar area, give yourself way more time than you think you’ll need in case you get lost.  

Honestly, I’ll be surprised if I get a yes from this company. To be fair, I already thought I blew it before the interviews even started because I couldn’t get the mini project they assigned to work properly. I just cleaned up what I had and submitted it.  

That said, I have another second-round interview today with a different company. It’s remote, I’ve eaten, and I’m feeling more prepared. (Also, I’m pretty sure what happened yesterday was low blood sugar because I felt much better after eating when I got home.) Wish me luck!

Update: Today's interview seemed to go well, but from experience, that can be deceiving. They gave me a list of questions yesterday, so I spent like an hour before prepping the questions and what my answer should be. 

Update 2: Just got the email, I got rejected because I didn't ask enough questions, and they felt I wasn't curious enough about the company. I could not roll my eyes harder. 

Exact quote from the email: ""Based on the evaluation, we won’t be proceeding at this time. While the homework was satisfactory and you did seem motivated and eager to learn. You had very little questions about the company and the interviewers didn’t feel a lot of interest from your side and also couldn’t provide enough detail about your experience so far, only on a very high level. Some parts could obviously be attributed to nerves, but the interview performance was not strong enough for us to be confident in hiring you.""",user_85,4,2

I am a neuro spicy lady WOC that just started a contract role at a FAANG in a product comms role. It’s my first time at a FAANG, although I have experience working in Fortune 500 companies and in tech. 

I’m about 2 weeks in, and I while I was informed that my teams moves very fast and the culture seems to be positive, I noticed an undertone of passive aggression, exclusion and competitiveness underneath the smiles. Coming from another competitive company, I know it can turn ruthless pretty easily, but it seems different here. I’m also noticing I’m on a team of all women, and I have a coworker with the same title as me who is already in with my boss and already working on projects while I’m sidelined and struggle to get the information I need to do my job. It’s like they will provide me information to show they’re including me, but I’m not trained on the information (usually told their schedule is busy and we’ll meet eventually) or I’m  left out of key meetings and projects while my coworker is not. I have volunteered my area of expertise to help support the team, and some team members will meet with me, but only provide surface level information or not get back to me when I offer help, while in syncs with both me and my coworker, they provide her with more in depth information and are happy to work with her. I’ve also been told that they’ll look something up for me and not follow up or refer me to someone else when it’s actually in their wheelhouse. 

Coworker has only been here for a week longer than I have, and the preferential treatment is explained away as “she’s just one week ahead, you’re both on the same page.” And while we do have the same meetings, she has additional ones and talks to my boss all the time (she’s told me so) and is accommodated. My boss will barely find 10 minutes to answer my questions or look at documents I’ve created to gather clarity, blaming her schedule as to why she can’t meet with me. 

I’ve tried jumping into meetings that weren’t on my calendar, but this led to the team making their calendars private and still excluding me from meetings. I’ve tried formatting my documentation similar to the company style and referencing old docs, but when I refer back to them, they’re deleted or moved. They even slowed down my onboarding to have me just look at docs and put a halt to shadowing opportunities even though I’ve informed my boss I’m a tactile learner (she wanted to know my learning style) and has dismissed me from syncs in favor of answering my coworkers questions. My coworker even put a meeting on my calendar to “come up with questions together to ask our boss” but when we did, my boss dismissed them and my coworker made fun of me for our joint question to differentiate our responsibilities? 

The biggest thing I noticed is when my boss told us about our responsibilities, I was told what I will “eventually” do while my coworker is told she has her own wheelhouse.

Coworker also tries to gather as much information on me- like my confidence level, if I’m dating, “where the hot guys are” (she’s married), telling me her insecurities about being on the team and also sharing some racially insensitive information about what she thinks about men or my race - she is also a minority but it was a radical change from when she first met me when she was much more polite about my background and I was to hers (as she’s East Asian). I did notice when we do meet, she makes sure to tell my boss everything that I/we do or to make a question out of it to show her leadership. That’s a common competitive/leadership tactic but it forces me in a more subordinate position when in reality I have more experience. I just haven’t provided value or haven’t done so quick enough.

Is this FAANG culture or is it the culture of my team?

There are no women managers in this division of the company, and in fact less than 10% women at all.

So my boss was acknowledging that reality - that I was going to be ineffective, but it hurt like hell. 

I’ve been looking for a new job for nearly a year, and have made it to the final round of interviews several times, but nothing has quite panned out yet. I’m feeling just sick about it all and am not sure what to do.

I don’t think I can actually fight this and do any good. Even if I “win” I don’t really win. 

Any advice is much appreciated.",user_885,313,50

So I have a master's in applied math that I earned last summer, and have since been basically unemployed since, except for a research fellowship thing that's only 15 hours a week and paying like $23/hr, which is the only relevant experience that I have for what I want to do in the future (ML/AI applied to scientific domains) (also yes, i am yet another person who wants to do ML but doesn't have a PhD ik it's saturated and I don't have a chance 😭)

I've honestly been having so much trouble getting so much as an interview, and living in a major tech hub in the US that I can't move out of for some reasons, I know for a fact there's literally thousands of people more qualified than I am. 

It's been over 9 months since I graduated. I'm wondering if it's time to give up. I can try focusing my job applications on something like teaching at private schools or community colleges, or doing curriculum development or something, but my only fear is that once I start working in education, it'll be near impossible to ever move back into what I actually want to do with my career. I'm not passionate about education at all, but my previous experiences as a TA for math classes, and an after school academy instructor also for math classes, coupled with any more education focused roles might just lock me in. 

But obviously, sometimes you just need a job, and I'm lucky to be able to live with my parents but it really is starting to feel like I'm freeloading off of them a little too much :/ 

Does anyone have advice on what to do? Should I continue trying? Or should I shift focus? And if I do shift focus, how would I be able to venture back into working in tech/science without an additional degree? ",user_1368,2,21

This makes it seem like I made a mistake when, in reality, these are new requirements that were never specified.

This isn’t the first issue I’ve had with him—he’s also taken credit for some of my work in the past. I’m starting to wonder if he’s intentionally undermining me or if I’m overthinking it. Either way, it’s creating unnecessary negativity, and I’d like to focus on solutions rather than just venting.

I want to strengthen my relationship with my manager by bringing solutions, not problems. Ideally, I’d like to minimize my interactions with this coworker if possible. Has anyone dealt with something similar? How do you handle a situation like this without looking like you’re just complaining?

Update: I asked him which ticket he was working on, and he named one that had nothing to do with the changes he was actually making. I then told him to document his changes, send them through QA, and follow the proper process. I'm working right now and tend to get distracted by Reddit, so I'll check replies later.

I'm mainly looking for community to share my journey with as I get started, as I am very community-oriented in terms of my personal motivation.

I want specifically women in this community because I need some space from the male-dominated culture of day-to-day tech employment, and because I've found some key differences in the applicability and quality of support that I get from men and women over the years.

So I (F,26) recently started working at a pretty big R&D company in a STEM/technical role. My coworker (M, 32) who started a month after me recently got a higher raise than me. We both came in at the same salary and we both had starting bonus at the same amount. I have 1 year of relevant work experience prior to this and 2 STEM bachelors degrees. He has 5 years experience and no degree. I believe our starting salary is fair for both of us since we bring different skillsets to the table. 

We recently had performance reviews and I thought mine went extremely well, with no negative feedback and a small but decent raise for how long I have been in the company. My coworker told me they got a higher raise than me today and I’m honestly shocked. I have been the one training others in my role (including them), training people with job titles above me, I am the one who has scientists reaching out to me to work on their projects since I have gained their trust for experiments, getting awards throughout the short time I’ve been here, and feel like I have been working my ass off. 

What I don’t understand is, if my peers are all having me as their go-to person and giving me great reviews AND my manager said I’m exceeding the expectations of anyone in the role I’m in ever has, why has my coworker been rewarded at a higher rate than me?

I just have no idea how to bring this up to my manager since I don’t want to come off as ungrateful or immediately point the finger towards gender pay gap if that isn’t what it is. 

One more thing to point out. I came in overqualified for this role and my manager and I plan on moving me up into a different position once I have been here for a certain amount of time. My coworker does not plan on leaving this role. 

Has anyone been in this position and could you please give some advice on what I should do, if anything?? Thanks in advance! ",user_1371,3,1

I started at our company about 2 years ago, and Al started 7 years ago out of college. I was promoted above him last summer, and became his boss. He did not take it well. Anytime I asked him to do something he would challenge me on it (“why can’t you do it?”) and is just generally very argumentative with me anytime I ask a question. I genuinely did not feel like a was managing him, because he refused to allow me to manage him. I think part of the problem was that I was promoted over him, but the other part is (I suspect) that I am a woman (I am the only woman on my broader team of 20 people). 

In January, Al was transferred to a different manager but in an adjacent team. This was because of the issues we were having. While I no longer manage him, we still have to work together. It hasn’t gotten any better. He’s still super argumentative and difficult to work with him, to a point where I avoid him and it’s affecting my job. 

What really tipped me over the edge today is that I discovered he withheld a project document (containing information on something we were jointly working on) for over two months from me. Everyone else involved had access but he “forgot” to share with me even when I asked multiple times if there was any documentation in the project. I have a very hard time believing it was an accident. 

I told Al’s new boss Chuck (M35) about this incident today and he said “what do you want me to do about it? tell Al you felt like it was intentional? Do you really think that it will help? I know you guys don’t get along but I don’t want to be in the middle”. I was stung and felt like I was being gaslight by his emphasis on the word ‘felt’, so I said don’t bother.

I’m now looking for advice whether I bring this to my boss, who is also Chuck’s boss. I’ve raised the issues I’ve had with Al in the past to my boss, and he’s generally been supportive (he’s had many conversations with Al giving him direct feedback), but I feel a little disappointed that this is still ongoing. He’s told me before that me and Al “both need to figure out how to get along”. I genuinely don’t feel like I’m the problem - I’ve never had an issue like this with another coworker, but Al is generally difficult to work with according to many people.  I don’t want to be perceived as just complaining endlessly, but Al is getting in the way of my job which I care about very much. I am the only woman in my group and so I don’t want people to think I’m being dramatic. What should I do? ",user_1379,15,8

How important is 'learning new things'?,"For a little background, I've been a developer for a very small dev shop for 8 years, and it's pretty much the only dev job I've ever had, so I feel a little sheltered and out of touch. Our job descriptions are informal and blurry. We're small. You just...do what needs done. So it's hard to say when you're 'doing more than your job description' or need a new title or whatever.



I'm also absolutely chicken shit about asking for raises. The one time I tried, the boss said genially that sure we could talk about that. So what new things have I learned since the last time I was given a raise? I didn't know what to say, and he said I could get back to him whenever I had put my case together. I turned it around in my head, but in the end I'm weak and I never brought it up again.



I have gotten raises that I didn't ask for now and then\*\* that have kept things acceptable, but I haven't gotten a raise or cost of living increase for over two years now in an area where the cost of living is exploding exponentially (even more than the nation on average, especially in proportion to the stagnant salaries). But what HAVE I learned to make the case?



Nothing terribly specific. I do have total conviction that I am extremely important to the company. I've been here the second longest of the handful of devs we have. I'm probably the most knowledgeable person about our biggest and most complex project. The PM makes comments all the time that when she really needs something done right, she gives it to me, even if it's something I haven't worked on before, because she knows one way or another I'll get it done and get it done well. I feel I bring particular value in that tickets often aren't fully described or thought out, and I will proactively talk things through with the person who requested the feature to help them think all the details through and make sure what is done will meet the user needs without unnecessary complication.



I don't learn a lot of new things lately, because my daily work hasn't necessitated that. I do feel a company needs to 'keep up with emerging technologies' but it feels like my coworkers are more passionate about that and have that area covered and will tell me when there is something new I need to adopt or should try. I don't know where I'd even find time outside work to try out new things while still maintaining a reasonable work/life balance.



So is it 'wrong' that I'm expected to learned something new (probably something technical) in order to get a raise, or should I push back on that? Am I being unreasonable trying to opt-out of keeping up with new tech as a developer? (Especially when it comes to AI, which I do mean to try out some time or another as a helper but...keep putting off. I have misgivings about the code quality and...well, I like figuring things out myself.) In a technical field, how does one advocate for improved soft skills being a reason for a raise? Especially when these meetings on the matter are in person and I...struggle to speak with conviction.



I also wonder how much of the boss's focus on 'what have you learned' is just that he hardly knows what I do on a daily basis these days. Is it fair at all to find a polite way to say 'can this decision be put in the hands of people who actually work with me?' 







(\*\*Notes on the raises I did get: I was hired on at a pretty low pay, straight out of a coding bootcamp (though I had a masters degree in a somewhat but not entirely unrelated field, undergrad in English/Linguistics. I believe all my coworkers have are or working towards undergrad degrees in compsci or similar), and my first raise took years but was 20% and pretty much given out of the blue. Boss literally cried when he gave it to me and thanked me for all I did. I get the impression he must have wanted to give me one before, but the company was only just then able to afford it. I think some years after this is when I tried asking and failed. Then a vital coworker on our small team left, and the day they told me they gave me I think a 10% or 15% raise. Not sure of the motivation there (realization we can go elsewhere and get better pay? compensation for the fallout the remaining devs would inevitably have to deal with?). Maybe a year or two later, my pay just increased 5% with not so much as a word from anyone. I do feel like my boss wants to do right by me, but I still worry about being too much of a doormat.)



(Also, yes, I know. The best way to improve your pay is to change jobs. But in a field where it can be hard to be female, this place has always made me feel comfortable. I feel like they value and respect me, despite my self-depreciating nature. It's far from perfect, and I wish that respect was reflected more in my pay. But the couple times I've poked my head into the workplaces of developer friends, it feels like something worth staying for if I can.)

I am a mid-senior in…let’s just say an environmental engineering company.

My management chain and all of my immediate colleagues are men. There are 2 young women in the newest cohort of new staff.

It’s been a perpetual state of flux for several years: major staff loss during the pandemic, followed by a first round of onboarding the replacements (some of whom are still not up to speed 3 years in), followed by standing up a major project and a second round of onboarding several new staff last year. My management chain has either had vacancies, dual-role coverage, or interims for 4.5 or the last 5 years. 

I’m burned out. I’m filing extension requests left and right. I have “temporarily” absorbed some responsibilities of the departed staff for 5 years. I have struggled to offload junior tasks to the new hires, with middling success. The latest person in the immediate manager person looks promising, but he’s still not oriented. I am both a doer and a delegator, I lead teams and projects but do not have direct reports. The junior staff have at times reported to someone who is managing 25+ so I’ve been providing coverage, training.

The newest round of staff seem great but they are working at new hire level: they ask for more feedback and handholding than is easy for me to give without getting smothered and cranky. I want to train them on things, and then be able to give them a list of 10 tasks and have them report back in a week. Some ask for feedback every hour: I’ve told them I just can’t do that and they’ll need to cultivate the right balance of “figure-it-outtitude” vs wheel-spinning.

Basically I want my team to have trained and replaced mid level staff but it takes time, years. Many days in the time it takes me to complete 1.0 things, 1.2 have been added to my list, for years.

I’ve been frank with the newest manager that I’m drowning and we need to come up with a plan to reallocate work and ask more of the newer staff.  

I understand that too much “complaining” and I won’t be taken seriously. Particular female curse.

*Is this just midlife?* *Is this just middle management?*

I can’t tell if I’m looking at the light at the end of the tunnel of years of taking on water, or what. Is this just midlife overwhelm, perimenopause, midlife crisis?

Do y’all have this task list that’s expanded to 200 items to track and execute forever? I know I gotta let some stupid stuff slide, but most of it is priority work.

I’ve tried to offload lists of 10 things to juniors. Some have openly told me that it “makes them feel bad” to track that much 🙄 I’m at risk of becoming Chinese takeout b*tch lady.

I am a software engineer, been working for 6 years pretty comfortable with my coding and feel I contribute well to my team in that regard. However, I am lost when it comes to dev ops. I have basically completely given up when it comes to finding a mentor, gave up pretty early on, so I am on my own. I think we can all relate to this, but my team lead responds to questions with like, 5 words, oftentimes the manager literally has to prompt him to answer my questions in meetings. I ask a question, he doesn’t say anything, manager says “insert_name, what do you think of that”. 
I am trying to learn kubernetes so I can address issues that block my development myself, but the documentation (even just the concepts) is extensive and a lot of it just doesn’t mean much to me. My company does support trainings, I am wondering if y’all can recommend some trainings? I am just lost when it comes to dev ops issues, which are often blocking me and my project does not have any dev ops roles. 

tldr: SE that gets blocked from dev ops issues. I’m bad at devops, try to learn reading documentation but I’m lost and team isn’t helpful. Where to learn? Trainings or tutorials that actually help with issues, ie debugging bad configuration

Some team lead jobs came up last year that I went for and got that job. The job was never recognised as a level so I have been double jobbing doing development and leading the team. I also never got a pay bump. 

There were 4 team leads for 4 product pillars. We all got an email last week about 3 manager roles for those 4 pillars. I asked my manager and he was turning me against going for it saying there are only 3 roles so don’t be annoyed if I don’t get it.

I applied anyway and had to do 2 rounds which went extremely well, along with a presentation. 
My manager setup a call for 15 minutes yesterday saying I wasn’t selected with no reason. He didn’t even mention it was a tough decision, so seems like the candidates were already selected and he completely wasted my time.

I asked for feedback and he gaslit me saying I should be doing more, getting more involved with projects which is complete BS, and I called him out for that. I’m leading more projects than any other team lead. He also said if I work harder there will be more positions.. so do more work for less pay and do exactly what the managers are doing.

What isn’t sitting right is 3 men got the job and I was the only female rejected. I have more skills than a lot of them. It’s also super embarrassing now that they will be announcing these new roles to the company and I’m the only team lead left that hasn’t been promoted. 

Am I to just accept this and continue doing what I’m doing with no progression? I feel like I’ve been completely taken advantage of and manipulated into doing more work now so I can get this manager role in the future. 

Any advice appreciated. I feel like I need to setup another call and show him how the optics do not look good, looks like gender bias. 
At this point, I’m open to moving to another company, I really enjoy working with the people but can’t believe how  I’ve been treated.

Since then I have been interviewing piecemeal but it's gone nowhere until now. I couldn't start a job at short notice and I pulled out of a couple of processes for this reason. I'm a Product Manager and I gave birth 11 days ago. It was a traumatic labour though the birth itself was OK despite forceps - but there was a bed shortage on the ward hence I was denied an epidural for 8 hours. I was in the hospital again for 2 days as baby had lost too much weight because I've not been able to produce enough milk until now. My body feels like a stranger to me. My baby is adorable and thankfully gaining weight again thanks to formula. 

So those were the circumstances under which I had a second round interview today (remote) . I do not have a good feeling about it and pretty sure a rejection awaits me. I'm so tired, fed up and burned out. Literally feel unable to focus on interviewing because I'm just so exhausted from lack of sleep, my interview prep is lacking and I am pretty sure I spent too long coming up with answers to obvious questions. But we're living off one median income + savings now (although HMRC will finally start paying out my Statutory Maternity Pay) and the growing gap in my cv stresses me out. 

I don't have a husband with a high paying job though he is a star in many other ways, he's a complete natural with the babe and he's always taking work off my hands.

I put in extra hours, volunteered for everything, and got praised as a top performer. But instead of rewards, I got more work, more stress, and watched people who did less climb the ladder. I finally hit a wall. The urgent-but-not-really requests, the endless meetings, the performative grind - it all started feeling pointless. I wasn’t saving lives, yet people acted like we were launching rockets to Mars. My motivation tanked, and suddenly, I wasn’t the star player anymore. Just another employee doing their job. And honestly? That realization almost broke me.

Now, I'd like to share the most impactful 5 lessons I’ve learned, along with thoughtful summaries of the chapters that resonated with me most:

**- Your body may stuck in an incomplete stress cycle (""**[**Burnout""**](https://befreed.ai/book/burnout-by-emily-nagoski) **by Emily and Amelia Nagoski)**

These twin sisters (one a health educator, one a conductor) blend science and compassion to explain why women experience burnout differently. Their explanation of ""human giver syndrome"" hit me like a truck - finally understood why I felt obligated to overperform. Here’s a quote from the summary of the most impactful chapter about burnout caused by social expectation in society: ""the authors introduce the concept of 'Human Giver Syndrome,' where women are expected to be caregivers, always putting others' needs before their own. This syndrome is deeply rooted in societal expectations that women must be pretty, happy, calm, generous, and attentive to others, never ugly, angry, upset, ambitious, or attentive to their own needs."" 

**- Act like a leader, not a worker ( ""**[**Executive Presence**](https://befreed.ai/book/executive-presence-by-sylvia-ann-hewlett)**"" by Sylvia Ann Hewlett**) 

A Harvard researcher breaks down what actually gets people promoted. Spoiler: It’s not hard work, it’s how you present yourself. Below is a key quote from the summary that provided the actual strategies on how to enhance my communication skills: 

""First, work on your speaking skills. This includes your grammar, accent, and the timbre and pitch of your voice. Practice speaking clearly and confidently, varying your tone to keep your audience engaged.

Second, learn to read the room. Pay attention to non-verbal cues and adjust your communication style accordingly. This skill is particularly important in diverse, global environments.

Third, master the art of storytelling. People remember stories far more than they remember facts and figures. Use anecdotes and examples to illustrate your points and make your message more memorable.

Lastly, don't underestimate the power of listening. Good communication is a two-way street. Show genuine interest in what others have to say, ask thoughtful questions, and demonstrate that you value their input.""

**- Detach from validation (""**[**The Mountain Is You**](https://befreed.ai/book/the-mountain-is-you-by-brianna-wiest)**"" by Brianna Wiest**)

A deep dive into self-sabotage and why we tie our self-worth to external achievements. This one hit me hard. Really love this book and this author. 

**- Stop delivering early ( ""The 48 Laws of Power"" by Robert Greene**)

This book, a cult classic on strategy and influence, taught me that overperformance can be a trap. Delivering work ahead of schedule only increases expectations: pace yourself.

**- Use strategic incompetence (""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck"" by Mark Manson**)

 A blunt, hilarious guide to letting go of what doesn’t serve you. One lesson? If you’re too good at something you hate, pretend you’re bad at it.

Now I do my job well, but I don’t overextend. I don’t chase gold stars. I leave on time. And for the first time in years, I don’t feel guilty about it. If you’re burning out, know this: You don’t owe your soul to a company. Work is just work. ",user_769,3280,151

Whenever an effect seems to magically ""just happen"", I assume that at least one person is working hard behind the scenes to make this happen. 

Who here has some insight into this?  I'm especially interested in how DEI functions in performance reviews / levelling and hiring. How do you get diverse people in the door?

Hey Reddit,

I’ve been in my current corporate job for 2 years, and it’s my first experience working in a larger company. Before this, I spent 10 years in startups and worked at a small, family-owned business while putting myself through college. I was also recently diagnosed with ADHD, which has made me realize I process information differently.

My role focuses on client retention (no sales quota), with a portfolio of 100 clients ranging from small to enterprise-sized. Most of the products I support are in maintenance mode, and a majority of my portfolio relies on a product that doesn’t integrate with our other products. I strategize at the beginning of the fiscal year on how to meet my targets via annual price increases. Even though my portfolio is in maintenance mode, my retention goal still increases annually by over $1M.

Key Issues:

— My manager gives praise but rarely offers constructive feedback or actionable steps for improvement. When I ask for clarity on what “thinking strategically” means, I get no clear guidance. I’ve built processes and operations from scratch in previous roles, which I consider strategic thinking, but my manager says they can’t teach me how to do that.

— I’ve also been critiqued for not memorizing every detail of my accounts (which was never a requirement when I applied) and for having a stutter, despite it improving with medication. This feels unfair and may even border on discrimination.

Feedback Summary:

Strengths:

— Strong client relationships and collaboration with internal teams.

— Proactive problem-solving and creating consistency.

— Meeting most deadlines, fostering client adoption, and identifying growth opportunities.

— Clear communication with clients and colleagues.





Areas for Improvement:

— Strategic Thinking: I’m told I need to “think strategically,” but I get no clear examples or direction on how to develop this.

— Revenue Growth: Need to focus more on cross-selling and naturally introducing complementary solutions.

— Commercial Understanding: Develop a better understanding of the commercial side of our business. (This one confuses me, because I understand how renewals, cx sells, and upsells impact the business/revenue).

— Handling Complex Situations: I’m encouraged to manage challenging customer calls better, but my solutions are often dismissed, and I feel criticized for not offering the “right” answers.

— Confidence: Work on communicating with more confidence, especially in high-stakes situations.


I feel stuck because while I receive praise, there’s little constructive feedback or guidance on how to improve in the areas that matter. For example, when I ask for examples of clarifying questions, I don’t receive concrete answers.

How can I better navigate this situation and ask for actionable, concrete feedback that helps me grow? 
How would you handle a situation like this? How can I ask for more concrete feedback in a way that doesn’t feel like I’m being put on the spot or blamed for issues?
Maybe I just need a mentor, what sites do you recommend?

Because I really don't have many people IRL I can talk to about this.

For context, **I'm 31F and single**, have been working in tech since post-undergrad - so nearly **10 years**. I work at a large company in NYC (not FAANG, but FAANG competitive salary - almost 200k base + equity). By the end of this year, I'll have almost 500k saved.

I dread logging in / commuting to work most days though (sounds like a decent amount of us do here). I didn't get a promotion likely because I'm not ""over-performing"" anymore, and don't play into politics / ""getting in front of everyone + being super visible"" anymore. . Most of the people I work with I like, which helps, but I really am not sure I can see myself doing this for 5+ more years (I'm senior product designer, not engineering).

It feels silly and selfish of me to not be more grateful for the path I've made for myself, but maybe I'm realizing it's not the path I want anymore? I'd hate to lose the high salary - so I fear quitting the industry in general. I don't even know what else I would do, other than take a lower paying local job at a plant store or something (honestly would love that haha).

I've thought of switching companies too, or taking a 6+ month sabbatical because I'm single, have no dependents. To explore creative passions, volunteer, maybe even move states. The world / economy feels so up in the air though, so I worry this would also be shooting myself in the foot.

Anyways! Thanks for listening. A lot of other posts on here make me feel less alone. Sorry if this sounds privileged / tone deaf. May we all find happiness, meaning, and peace in our lives. ❤️

I’m currently about to finish my second semester and so far I’ve learned HTML,CSS,JS, a little of PHP and Jquery for coding. Ive learned a lot of ux/ui and design fundamentals. I’ve done a handful of projects for school that got great marks but not confident enough to add to my portfolio. I will most likely re-do those projects into something I am more proud of. 

With that being said, can you guys give me helpful tips when it comes to creating a good portfolio? What should I include and not include? I’m hoping to apply to some internships to get some experience during summer break but im not sure what to add to my portfolio and make it look attractive to recruiters/hiring managers. 

Any tips would be appreciated! Thank you in advance :)) <3

It wasn't until I met my friend this year that I even realized all those issues were not just me being lazy or it was all in my head. Funny enough, she's actually diagnosed but something we both struggled with is how there are no good options on the market for managing our executive dysfunction day to day-- especially too with added complications for women.

We started out wanting to create community and have been doing body doubling sessions. We've been doing them once a month and you can join the next one here: [link to join](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/flowgenius-do-the-hard-stuff-body-doubling-session-tickets-1277972192229?utm-campaign=social&utm-content=attendeeshare&utm-medium=discovery&utm-term=listing&utm-source=cp&aff=ebdsshcopyurl)!

Just to clarify this is a productivity app first, not a tracking app-- that data would be externally synced to it.

There are companies in EU and UK which have decent people in leadership who continue to support diversity and equality. For them it is not a mere “company policy” but a key requirement for success.  Keep looking.

I’ve been meaning to write this for some time and finally found the time (the irony). :)

Ever since becoming a mother two years ago, I’ve found it really hard to make time for my usual activities—running, hobbies, or even just staying engaged with industry trends. 

The biggest struggle I face is feeling left out of group conversations at work.

At some point, I realized I was only talking about daycare schedules, sleep training, or potty training, while my peers were deep in discussions about new AI trends, industry shifts, or the latest product launches.

 I felt like I was falling behind, losing my edge—and that was really frustrating personally

I recently decided to change that. Instead of trying to carve out “extra” time (which never happens), I looked for **ways to use passive time** more effectively—stroller walks, kitchen chores, running. Here are a few things that worked for me:

• **Tech Newsletters**: Subscribing to Morning Brew, TLDR, and Lenny’s Newsletter helps me stay updated with quick, high-impact insights in just 10-15 minutes every morning.

• **Podcasts During Work & Chores**: Lenny’s Podcast has been great for product and growth insights. Would love recommendations for other women-in-tech-focused podcasts!

I recently enjoyed listening to Nice Girls Don’t Get Corner Office

• **Audiobooks & Short-Form Learning**: I struggle with long audiobooks—I rarely finish them before forgetting what I last heard. I recently started exploring **short-form book podcasts**, and it’s been a game-changer for squeezing in knowledge during commutes or stroller walks.

When I started talking to other working moms, I realized I wasn’t alone—many felt they were losing their edge at work and struggling with mom guilt.

For me, experimenting with different ways to **stay engaged without extra effort** has been a game-changer. 

I’ve recently listened to *Pay Up*, Nice Girls Don’t Get Corner Office, and *How to Raise Girls*, and those small moments of learning made me feel reconnected with both my career and personal growth.

I’d love to know—how do you balance staying updated while juggling work and parenting? Do you have go-to resources, strategies, or hacks that help you keep learning without burning out?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",user_1399,0,9

A few months ago, I started a new role in tech sales for an established, name-brand company. It’s a great product, but a completely new industry for me — to keep it short, it’s been an incredibly difficult transition that’s somehow caused more stress than a year of unemployment. 

I’ve worked in male dominated sectors for years at this point, but this is my first time being the ONLY woman hired for a position. My colleagues are great guys, but they can’t fathom what it’s like to be a woman in tech. The hurdles we face are completely alien to them, the advice they give is borderline comical at this point. 

Trying to be proactive, I reached out to the sole woman in a leadership position at this organization hoping to find a mentor. What she told me absolutely broke my spirit. 

When we connected, she told me straight up that I’ll be successful if I talk less and dress better. She recommended that I start getting professional blow-outs, listed a few stores she shops at for clothes to improve my wardrobe and told me, in earnest, that men don’t appreciate opinionated women so I’m only doing myself a disservice by leading with my intellect. I sobbed when I got off the call. 

It’s taken me a long time to really process this conversation, I’m definitely still working through it because I’m posting here today.

The idea that my value is intrinsically tied to something I’ve done nothing to earn with diminishing returns, my outward appearance, is horrifying. The worst part of it all is that I genuinely believe this woman was trying to be kind. She was telling me “the truth” when we spoke and I absolutely hate it.

The complete burnout I’ve had since this chat is staggering. I was already feeling overwhelmed by the role, but this conversation was the last nail in the coffin for me.

I’m definitely fucking myself over by mentally checking out, but apparently my position doesn’t require much brainpower anyway.

Just seeking some solidarity and to remind all of us that we’re so much more than objects for the male gaze.

EDIT: 

Wow, this really blew up! Thank you all for the support and sage insights. I’m trying to go through comments to respond now. 

I’m cringing writing this, but it feels necessary to clarify — I’ve benefited from a lot of “pretty privilege” in my life. I’m absolutely not showing up to work like a slob, I take pride in my appearance and have “played the game” enough to get where I am today. 

I’ve also worked my ass off, constantly raising the bar and challenging myself intellectually. To ask someone for technical advice and be told that I’d do better without curly hair and a voice was absolutely devastating because … how I look is the least interesting thing about me. It’s the least interesting thing about EVERYONE, frankly. 

It just feels like we, as women, put in 250% effort only to be judged on the genetic lottery. It’s bullshit, it’s not fair and it needs to fucking stop. ",user_812,854,143

Last year, I was waiting for a promotion/level change at my old job, which was supposed to happen in September but didn’t. It was quite a manageable job and due to my past experience in a similar role I was exceeding at the role. Not wanting to wait for another cycle, I applied for a new INTERNAL role—VERY different from my previous one—and got an offer. When I approached my manager to match it, she said salary changes were closed, and they had already pushed for my level change, and it was close to the new salary but it will happen in March but it’s not a guarantee. 

Despite that, I decided to take the new job. Now, a month in, I really don’t like it—to the extent that I already want to start looking again. For a 13% raise, I traded off 50% more work with a hyper-busy team, and it’s not what I expected including the cut throat competitive team members. Above all, I don’t like the project itself. 

I feel like a made a grave mistake, 8 years of my career and I have never had such feeling before. I wish I had a mentor to guide me. 

Recently, when going over my appraisal with my new manager, I went through my performance review and my old manager had indeed put in great recommendations and also was rewarded a great bonus due to that and could have gotten promotion had I stayed. 

I’m tempted to reach out to my old manager to see if they’d take me back, but I also feel quite ashamed for leaving in the first place. Given the market, I’m unsure how soon I can land another job if I start looking again.

Though any advice would be helpful. 
For context, I have been trying to build my team remotely for the place I work. I have successfully inducted many talented individuals and have trained them never having met them in person. I am the only senior level manager who is remote. There have been many times where some of the talent I have trained have quit due to their interactions with the partners of this workplace. The interactions have been derogatory or of a judgy or bullying nature (or so I have been told from them) and I have tried my best to stand up for them and tell the partners to behave(in the nicest way I could). Anyway one of the things they do is, in meetings where I am not available, they double down on my team members and force them to do things that I have categorically told them not to do or things that even my team members know are the wrong course of action as we are a highly specialised team. The partners have zero experience in my field so they also don't make sense and don't really understand what we do as well. In one recent instance, a new member of my team was in a meeting on his own with some people including one of the partners. He has only been here a few days and is catching up with his role and the clients history. Despite knowing this they ganged up on him and tried to criticise him for not being informed and tried to get him to make decision that they know he's not experienced enough to make nor authorised to make without my approval. This has happened multiple times and it is exactly these types of interactions that lead to some really talented people quitting their jobs. This only happens in calls where I am not present. This time however I lost my cool and I messaged the partner after the interaction. The conversation is attached below. The guy then wrote me passages and then started calling me repeatedly. I didn't pick up because usually when he gets like this he gets really vile and yelly and begins denigrating me. So out of fear I let his phone calls ring, I also was out at the time(it was a day off) so I couldn't have this man yelling slurs at me  around people I know.

The Challenges I’m Facing:

	•Current Company: No clear path for growth, and leadership roles aren’t opening up for me.

	•New Job Applications: Most higher roles require “prior leadership experience” managing teams or budgets, which I don’t officially have.

	•Same Loop, No Growth: I feel like I’m just doing more of the same without real upward movement.

	•How can I break into a Director or Head of Data role without already holding an official leadership title?

	•Should I reposition my resume to focus more on strategy, business impact, and cross-functional leadership?

	•Are there alternative roles or industries where my experience can be leveraged for a leadership jump?

	•Any networking, courses, or certifications that can make a difference?

After our first homework set I received a no-pass and was told I need to rewrite the solutions to pass the assignment. This was in the syllabus and I am fine with it, but when I went to ask him a question at the end of class he loudly exclaimed if I had received his feedback and even pulled up his laptop in front of everybody to start talking about it. This was unprompted as everything was already written out on the platform we use. I believe he was purposefully doing it in front of people.

This past class he has started completely ignoring me when I raise my hand while taking other's questions. I hold it up for a long time. It is obvious. Also my gut feeling told me to run. He might use any other assignments as a power-trip and it's treading the territory of emotional abuse.

The problem is that the man they have appointed to be in charge of sexual harassment cases for the department acts and looks like a sexual predator, I already got a super weird vibe from him and he came to sit near me during our program introduction completely ignoring my discomfort. I have realised this might be on purpose to deter anyone reporting things.

Any ideas? I might just drop this class.",user_972,129,30

It was an event for women, which I was really excited about, hoping to expand my community of women in tech. The event was a presentation about how to use AI in your personal life as a woman. The presenter began with an example of how she has been using chat GPT to lose weight after having a baby, stating that “when you get to be a certain age, it’s hard to lose the weight”. I was shocked. Speaking to an audience of hundreds of women and she chose to use the example of how to lose weight using AI. As a gen Z, I felt like I had traveled back in time. And then all I could think about was the negative environmental impact of AI and how using it for something like that seems like such a waste. And horrible to promote taking health advice over…idk…talking to a doctor or dietician if you’re concerned about your weight. I was kinda spiraling and wondering if my personal values conflict with the way tech is heading. All of my non tech female friends reject the use of chat GPT due to environmental concerns. I’ve noticed that not many people in tech are talking about that.

I know firsthand what it feels like to ping-pong between big tech, VC, startups, and entrepreneurship, yet still feel stuck and stagnant. It took years of self-doubt, career U-turns, and financial fear before I finally decided to pull the plug on corporate life and design a more authentic and fulfilling path as a career and executive coach.

Truth be told, it took me a long time to come to terms with leaving my former life behind. I had to confront my ego, financial anxiety, and internalized shame for wanting to leave a life I had worked so hard to build. Getting out of this mind fog required me to give myself enough space—mentally, emotionally, and financially—to grow into the new identity I was creating. Wanting to leave is one thing; financially de-risking that decision and shifting self-limiting beliefs so you can actually walk away is another game entirely. Honing this “walkaway power” was critical to building a new life aligned with my values.

Starting next month, I’m excited to share my method for creating your own “walkaway power” in small 1:5 group sessions designed for women in tech.

Remember: courage isn’t the absence of fear; it’s doing the right thing even when you’re scared. While I can’t promise to rid you of all fear, we can get you to a realistic place where you’re confident in doing it anyway. Cheers to you, the power of community, and the beginning of a truly transformative period in your life!

Before that 10 years clinical experience. Was a manager for a significant amount too but I would like to be an analyst for the rest of my days and solve problems. 

I started at a new healthcare institution last year. My direct boss is great. I love working for him. The problem is a project came up and no one else really had the experience to deal with it so they pulled me in. I am now working with the other boss who is the equivalent of my boss. She is a female in her 30s and a very good analyst and really knows the system, but doesn’t have the experience of projects like I do.

I have struggled to try and get my work done as the part of this project I’m responsible for and it’s been hard because the leadership of the project is off the rails and the project is so far behind. All deadlines are in danger.  But I’ve managed to get what I need done and find out what I need to know.

Two weeks ago in a meeting with another team, it was clear that they didn’t know what they were doing. They were getting ready to throw in a bunch of code into the system and not test it so I raised questions about why no smoke testing and no regression testing. I didn’t call anyone out by name. I was just like that’s highly unusual. Perhaps we should consider testing.

The meeting became very combative and afterwards the co-boss took me aside and told me that I was aggressive, too critical, and I needed to tone it down with that team. I got really upset because that is not actionable feedback like what specifically do you want me to do when I hear people are putting code in the system and not testing it and moving it to production. 
It doesn’t help that maybe 10 minutes after I got off the phone with her the big boss two levels above her called me and asked what it happened. I told him and he told me to keep up the good work. 

So now my relationship with her is strained. I have asked to be removed from all project meetings. I will do whatever work is assigned. I met with her boss and my boss and never heard so much jargon and so little understanding in my life. He eventually said he cleared her to tell me that and when I asked him how that was actionable it was more BS. Afterwards my boss was like look I’m sorry but I think you do a great job and I’m 100% responsible for your reviews so please don’t leave. 

This week she has pulled me into meetings without disclosing they are about this project I think because she is a bit lost. 

So what do I do. I tried communicating with them. I’m still mad as hell. The project is still doing crazy a$$ $hit. 

I think I can decline all meetings from her period and say enter tickets for the work (my boss will support me). But I worry about the future if my boss leaves. He’s not planning to but I otherwise really like working here. 

Thanks in advance

I recently posted a tragic plea for help asking for advice on landing my first job as a frontend developer, and I got one!!

Now the confetti has settled, I'm beginning to have some nerves. I was told by the leader of my coding course not to accept start-up junior roles as they're very difficult/chaotic but I've had a year half of successful freelancing and feel confident that given how impressed they were with my coding challenge submission, I'm qualified for the role. It's a generous salary and I'm really onboard with the vision of the company.

Due to my experience, they stripped away the term 'junior' on my contract, the lead engineer (also a lady!) reassured me that she'll be there to help whenever I need to be walked through something and the first month or so will be getting used to the code base and becoming familiar with the products. I love fast paced environments and don't have a family to support at the minute so can afford to invest more hours as I know overtime is basically a must with start-ups. I'm thinking, one-to-one mentorship, great salary, exciting ideas...I feel strangely at peace about it but is this naive?

Could really use some sagely wisdom!

I am the only woman in my department so basically I am invisible if i don’t do anything extraordinary and be a social butterfly which i am not. I am passionate about my work and I was in the end of 20s when i started so i had all the time in the world. So i gave my everything. Never said no. Was open to everything that came my way. Did multiple researches at the same time. I got burnt out once but recovered. And also got a performance bonus end of last year. I was okay working hard. I was okay not being seen. I tried networking many times but it’s very hard with all male teams. I work in germany and we bond over beer in the evening. Also I am an immigrant which makes things a little hard. I have tried networking during parties drinking beer but it never felt natural to me. I still tried. My new boss and old boss were happy working with me. I always delivered, it was all good. Until the start of this year. 

I fell sick. That’s when i truly saw how bosses with poor manager skills can affect you and also change how they see you. I had to cancel a project campaign because i couldn’t travel. And took a week off. My manager kept whatsapping me every day i was sick asking if i was okay and saying hoping i m better now. You would think that he sent to check up on me but no. Every-time it was something about the campaign. He over promised the customer (management fault) and he wants to get it done. He didn’t care i was sick. Stupid me did reply, so that the things will be okay but it put too much stress on me that i cannot rest and i got really angry for the first time in five years. I came back to work, pressure started from day 1. Asking me to complete things which will take lots of time. Also i m the only person in this project there is no replacement for me.( management fault). So the pressure was too much. I said no in so long saying i cant guarantee to finish this on time. I was also leaving for my planned vacation which my manager was informed months ago (again management fault for not considering these factors). 

The reason i wrote this post is today i explained my manager all the things, factors detailing the difficulties on why i cant complete this task in a week, why i would need more time and will continue with it after my vacation. And also added that there was a missing hardware too which will also hinder the progress (ordering or borrowing also has its own procedure which we both are aware of). 

His reply,
He ignored everything i said, it was a complete report and update. He ignored everything and only addressed the missing hardware part saying that i can request it from some other team and so i can complete the task in one week.  He selectively ignored the reasons that would affect me and my work load and always assumes that i would do it. (Not the first time) I replied to him saying that “NO unfortunately i cannot guarantee i can complete this on time. “Like i said” these are the challenges need to be solved “. And he replied “understood! Lets do this task then” and I replied again saying “this task is also a dependency which i explained above. I will try my best will keep you updated “. No reply from him. He usually puts a thumbs up and always always sends a smiley. I know when he isnt happy. And now he doesn’t address me properly. 

He did this when i was sick and now when i was assertive and pointed out that its not possible. Men who are my colleagues do this all the time, they are very straightforward tell no straight to face but this kind of reaction is only to me. But i am not going to be bothered by it. I feel guilty for not being able to finish it and for being assertive but i tell myself this is right for my mental health and i did the right thing. I always worked twice as hard as everyone else just because i am woman and have to prove myself to fit in. But that stops now. My confidence is high because of my anger due to continued disrespect. Some of my colleagues are condescending and passive aggressive all the time. And thats normal because they are men. I have tolerated all that. Not anymore. Our customers disrespected me once during tihis project when they didn’t reply to my suggestions or request and email instead only addressed my manager. I stopped talking to the clients directly now. My manager let me do the talking all this while, i was basically doing his job until now. Because the clients now don’t respect me, i am not taking my manager job now. I report him and he reports to the client. I said no to myself here and put a boundary. I am learning and growing. And i never want to be a manager ever. 

Why does it have to be this hard 😓

I’ve had three managers in three years. 

The newest manager and I butted heads a little at the start - he kept throwing impromptu meetings on my calendar and letting them run overtime, as well as dumping endless work on me. So much so to the point that I had a very bad meeting with him where I almost cried and asked for less work. I’m not saying I was perfect in this process! 

Anyway eventually I went to his manager because I was worried he’d fuck me come review time. Nothing really came out of that except she sat in on on a couple of my weekly meetings with him where he was not a dick. 

Anyway I simultaneously found out I am getting $30k less than my coworkers. Fuck it, I voiced that too, to both of them, in one of these two-on-one meetings. They said they’d look into it. HR came back with some bullshit about how I was still within the pay grade. Yikes.

 At this point it’s been all kinds of mess, and I give up: I’m a slave to the man, I can’t seem to get any other job or even interview in this hellscape of an election time so maybe I need fo just stay put. 

Anyway I get a below expectations off track from goals review. Which I was shocked about because I had hit my goals and done excellent work that year. I’d been gunning for a promotion when I got this new boss!

I expressed my shock in the call and that shock was documented in my rating’s notes (an act which was framed as some kind of concession to me) - not sure why. Except that he is a terrible manager because I genuinely had no idea why I would get that rating in terms of my work. 

Anyway that’s on a Friday. Tuesday I go into the office and we have a scheduled meeting. It’s bad. I’m emotional, although trying not to be. To defend the shit rating they said a lot of fucked things about my work. 

He suggests we take a walk instead of having our meeting. He says to ask him anything. I ask if I’m getting fired, if I’m getting PIPed, etc. 

He says no, that the company believes in me, blah blah blah. I am extremely honest with him about having 3 bosses in 3 years, wanting to make as much as my coworkers, etc. It felt like an end of the road conversation where anything could be said because things were already so fucked. Anyway we end on decent terms - I even ask what I can do to improve. This guy says communicate more with him. MORE?! But okay, I do, I invite the fucker to more meetings. 

They approve some $1500 training for me. Although I’ve yet to be reimbursed for it. For a while the energy is fine. 

Anyway come comp time. 2.25% raise. 6k bonus, instead of 12k. He even cracks a joke where he says “guess that increase doesn’t cover the price of eggs!” This is infuriating.

Anyway that’s where I’m at. If you made it to the end of this I salute you and ask: how fucked am I? Am I PIPed without getting PIPed? Also what in the corporate fuck is happening fo me? Arghhhhhhh",user_1020,56,28

What should I do?

Dear women in tech, this is my first post here so please forgive any missteps. I have been working as a technical business analyst at my current employer for around a year. The lead above me is leaving and I will take over his role. I had a domain change to enter this job: although I’m about 13 years into my career, it’s my first job at an IT company. However I’ve come to this role from research science (data heavy PhD and postdoc projects) followed by a tough stint in product development for a scientific instrumentation company… so I’m more than qualified/competent to take this on.

The issue I’m having is that the guy who’s leaving doesn’t want to let go. He talks down to me as if I don’t have any technical skills/treats me like an idiot. He keeps all the challenging work for himself while I get the scraps. In fact this got so annoying I was close to quitting over it, then found out he’s leaving so decided to stay. 

Trying to get him to handover work to me is like trying to get blood out of a stone, as he hoards information jealously to himself and won’t let go of any responsibilities. Fortunately I’ve known he’s leaving for a while, so I have been preparing myself and am now confident I’m ready to take the reins and smash it.

However there is a bigger problem with this handover. We have just delivered an implementation with a big client, which I will lead once he’s gone. It’s a very complex project so many issues remain to be resolved. There are two important managers on this project at the client and I spoke to both today. They know the guy above me is leaving so I wanted to check in about the handover. Well I got a massive shock. Even though I’ve been working predominantly on this project for the last 9 months, one manager asked who would be taking over from the guy who is leaving. In fact, she asked whether it would be either of two very new male employees who are helping on the project. Neither of them are competent in terms of knowledge or experience to take this on, as it’s highly technical. I corrected that manager right then and there and told her that I would be taking over and that in fact, one of those new guys is my subordinate. Then when I spoke to the other manager from the client, his response was “ well it won’t matter if he (the guy who is leaving) is gone because we’ll know how to use your software by then anyway so we’ll take over” which to me sounds like “you won’t be needed anyway”.

This is shaking me up a bit because I would’ve thought the project manager or someone should’ve communicated that it would be me taking over. Unfortunately, I think because I was doing a lot of the helping jobs/playing a supporting role earlier in the project, they’ve got into their heads that this will continue and I’m only a helper. 

So my plan now is: call my boss (who is supportive) and tell him I will be taking the reins from tomorrow. The guy who is leaving will support me with what I need to make this handover effective. And tell him the project managers need to make a clear statement to the client about the transition process. I’m super frustrated about this and I want to step up. Unfortunately, it really scratched some old wounds about sexism I experienced in previous roles but I guess this shit never stops.

Background for my question: I work for a global SaaS/IaaS firm where I was hired as an SA for both core product and customer custom solutions.  After many re-orgs (as is common in corporations looking for an easy button) we have finally landed on a model that seems to have consolidated all the product & dev teams. 

Which is overall a good thing, IMO, but they seem to have eliminated virtually all of the architecture roles as part of it, converting all the application architects that didn't get eliminated to either POs/PMs or Tech Leads. 

My solution architecture team got moved over into professional services, which I guess is better than being laid off (for now?) lol, but now it means that I have zero say on the product I'm expected to deliver. This worries me on a lot of levels. From a product perspective they are already making goofy mistakes because they are not thinking about the big picture. I also didn't sign up to be a talking head, if I wanted to do technical client communications only I would be in technical sales already and probably making more money.

1. What's AI/ML/NLP (literally just what they mean and how they fit together), and what are all the mildly technical terms you see in product updates (e.g. benchmark, SOTA, token) 

2. What does the AI ecosystem look like, aka what's OpenAI/Mistral/Anthropic and how they all fit together 

3. What does this mean for you in the humans vs. AI job market

4. How to set up your learning routine.

I also have put together a newsletter that contains free resources to learn AI for beginners, under the radar jobs in AI-enabled companies across the US, and AI events around the country as let's be real, connecting offline is a hugely beneficial and efficient way to learn what's the word on the ground.

Why do people think men are smart just because they are overly confident?  

Let me share my experience observing men and their behavior. Many of them were considered successful, they were business owners at 25, startup founders, or had impressive careers.  

At first, when I worked and interacted with them, I felt inferior. Their image and achievements suggested they must be incredibly intelligent and successful.  

But when I had the chance to get to know them closely and talk with them, I observed one thing, they were all overly confident, to the point that they often said stupid things without realizing they were wrong.  

In fact, interacting with these so-called ""successful"" men actually made me more confident. Listening to them and watching them in action, I noticed a shocking level of ignorance, shallowness, lack of critical thinking, and poor judgment.  

A large part of their success is just an illusion. Before meeting them, I assumed they must be highly intelligent because they had achieved so much at a young age. But in reality, their attitude was more like overconfident students, self-absorbed and unaware of their own mistakes. I often found myself thinking, I’m actually smarter than them.  Why was I so worried and insecure about myself when I found them to be nothing special? It was a huge confidence boost for me, seeing that their image as genius entrepreneurs was just a facade.

The difference between me and them, I wasn’t as confident. They thrived in their ""bro circles,"" hyping each other up. Every single one of them thought they were the next Elon Musk. In their minds, they saw themselves as visionaries, entrepreneurs, and entitled geniuses.  

Unfortunately, many people, especially those without real insight or expertise, fail to see through this illusion. They mistake confidence for intelligence. In reality, these men often have terrible ideas, but they push them forward because they influence others with their ego and presence.  

It happened to me that I worked with a group of tech bros on an innovative tool. I talked to them and listened to their ideas for the solution. Most of their ideas were shallow and poorly thought out. When I tried to suggest a better idea, they ignored me and insisted on going with their own approach.  

Later, when we presented the solution to more knowledgeable people, they pointed out the exact same flaws I had warned about. I couldn't help but feel that if they had only listened to me, the project would have been a success. Of course, they didn’t even remember that I had suggested that solution earlier.  

They are a group of overconfident men, often lacking creativity. They design solutions as they are self-centered, with little consideration for clients' needs. Their understanding of users is minimal, and their creativity is weak. Overconfident and self-absorbed, they are definitely not as smart as they present themselves to be.  

And in a patriarchal society, a male entrepreneur is automatically considered smart. A woman, people are skeptical.  
When a man presents an idea, people associate him with the next Elon Musk, the next ""tech bro genius,"" just because he's male. There’s a huge bias in favor of men, which makes them seem far more intelligent than they actually are.  

Ladies, I highly recommend being more confident in yourselves. Don't be fooled by the illusion of male competence. Confidence isn’t the same as intelligence.

Two minutes later a man now brings up the same point and now everyone sees it clear as day and agrees! There are days where I’m like I’ll take my logic and analytical skills and shut up and do minimal work. Then there’s days where I could strangle someone through the screen. I’m tired of listening to podcasts and watching Instagram videos to deal with micro aggressions at work. When will this end?! I have to say my coworkers are really nice but there’s scenarios where I feel like should I call them out..

Edit (3/10) : so last week in a meeting, same thing happened. A junior dev was going on about something he’s going to do and he talked for 1-2 minutes and I saw a problem. Waited to see if someone would say anything and when it was clear no one is thinking about what I’m thinking, I brought up my point. Suddenly everyone else is talking like why it is a big concern and we should explore other options etc. When they finished I said that is why I brought this up because I don’t think it would work because of so and so reason. Yay me! I was so happy when I said and I was louder and cheerful than usual when I said it. So no one could cut me off. Usually this is the point where my frustration takes over and I don’t speak since I don’t want to sound like a lunatic. Thank you ladies for all your shared experiences.

From running homes to leading nations, they have shown strength, wisdom, and courage. Yet, history has often seen women being turned against each other. And sadly, many times, men play a silent but strong role in this.

A confident, successful woman is often seen as a threat. Society, knowingly or unknowingly, fuels competition between women. It starts with small things—who is more beautiful, who is a better wife, who is more successful at work. These comparisons create jealousy, misunderstandings, and fights. But have we ever asked—who benefits from this?

Many times, men use this divide to maintain their own power. A woman fighting another woman takes attention away from the real issues. At workplaces, one woman is promoted, and instead of supporting each other, women are made to believe they must fight for a place at the table. At home, family members compare daughters-in-law or sisters-in-law, making them rivals instead of allies.

But imagine if women stood together. Imagine if every woman refused to bring another woman down. The world would change. Women would rise higher, support each other, and create a future where power is shared, not fought over.

The truth is simple—when women unite, they are unstoppable. It’s time to break the cycle. It’s time to lift each other up. Because real power is not in competing. Real power is in standing together.",user_1005,0,16

I’ve been on the market for awhile looking for a job and have been getting rejections left and right. 

I was able to land an interview a few days ago with an engineer for a frontend position and have been prepping for weeks leading up to it. It was the most demoralizing interview I’ve ever had…

Starting off with intros: he introduced himself and then when it came to my turn mid way through my intro he rolls his eyes at me and takes a long sigh. 

During my interview I was stuck on a small position of the code ans asked some clarifying questions. I was having some trouble understanding what he was saying —naturally I asked him to repeat his question or rephrase his question/response to make sure I understood him correctly, to which, I noticed his tone changed and he became annoyed. This was the tone for the entire interview and I became really anxious and started to stumble on my words and forgetting the smallest things I had to during the technical interview but continued to communicate my thoughts and what I wanted to do with the problem I was given. He would make small comments like “oh you don’t know how to do x?”, almost in a condescending way. 

I’ve been interviews where I’ve had amazing experience with some interviewers and time like this makes me fee like I’m in not good enough and makes me second guess myself with the skills I have to do the job up until now. 

tl;dr: Had a bad technical interview experience and left with thought of not being good enough after being on the market for a while. ",user_1435,40,13

Don't get me wrong; I would love to work for this company and have this job, but it's a step more senior than what I've been. I'm also not understanding why they want to meet me, because while I can 100% do the job, a lot of my experience is irrelevant for what they're asking. Considering that I've been failing interviews for less senior positions where my experience is a 100% fit, there's a loud voice in my head saying, ""Why even bother trying?""

Can anyone get me outside my head here? I’m preparing to fail, but I don’t want to talk myself out of this. I'm having trouble preparing and briefly contemplated asking the hiring manager what they were thinking. Considering the job market now, there had to have been better fits.

But for *her*, it became a trap.

A drunken male colleague, fueled by insecurity,  spun a venomous lie. In front of the boss’s wife, he hissed that the Marketing Head—a woman who’d poured her soul into the company—was having an affair with the boss. The words hung like poison in the air. The wife’s heart cracked. The room froze. And the woman, innocent but marked, stood in the eye of the storm.

When they returned, the whispers became weapons. The director’s partner and son, threatened by her brilliance, twisted the lie further. They painted her as a villain, a seductress, a threat. Meetings turned into battlegrounds. Colleagues she’d trusted turned their backs. But she wasn’t alone. Four fierce women stood beside her—her shield, her solace, her *superpower*. Together, they defied the noise.

Yet the irony cut deep. The man who started it all roamed the office freely, laughing at the wreckage. The boss—the one she’d *never* crossed lines with—vanished for 20 days, leaving her to drown. He knew the truth. *He knew.* But he let silence condemn her.

Nights blurred into tears. She replayed every moment: *Was it trusting the wrong people?* *Her relentless dedication?* *Her refusal to shrink?* They punished her for existing, for succeeding, for breathing in a world that wanted her to suffocate.

Her strength came from her  female colleagues—the four who held her when the world shook. But in the quiet, she wondered: *Why must a woman fight so hard just to prove she deserves to stand?*

This isn’t fiction.  
This is the price of being a woman who shines too bright.

And here is a summary of ALL of the job hunting advice ive gotten from recruiters and others in the industry.

1. Use AI: Use AI to tailor your resume to every job you apply for. Use AI to find jobs. Use AI to fix your linkedin and fill out job aplications

2. Network like Crazy: There are hundreds if not thousands of people applying for the same job as you. If you can get a referral, youre in. Cold message people on linkedin. Go to networking events. Talk to everyone

3. Take any project: Do some pro bono work. Create a portfolio. Take any job/side quest that gives you experience. You can always keep looking while working at a job that isnt endgame.

4. Keep Learning: Take online cert courses, online classes, seminars, etc. Prove to future employers you arent sitting around while not working

5. Apply FIRST and apply OFTEN: If you dont apply within 3 days or the first 50 applicants, dont even bother wasting your time unless you are a perfect fit. Jobs leave the post up to have a pool of 'backup' applicants in case the first batch doesnt work out. But it usually will. SO .

6. Dont use 'Easy Apply': Its bullshit. If you dont want me using it why is it there? WELL apparently according to a recruiter from Inntuit, its there for reach, not for you to actually apply. SO dont use it. GO to the company site and apply there. Or get ghosted by current employees when you try to get a referral.

7. Im Exhausted: Playing this game really sucks balls and I hate it. I wish my resume spoke for it self. FFS im 26 with over 4 yrs of experience and I cant get an entry level role. I cant get an internship bc im not in school. I cant do rotational programs because I didnt graduate less than 2 years ago. Networking feels purely transactional as a neurodivergent person and I hate using people for a job. I hate this so much and Im lowkey crashing out today. So take breaks and be kind to yourself so you dont lose your mind playing this game. Ugh.

After several years at my company, I had great performance reviews, got promoted every year, and had solid relationships with my coworkers and leadership. I took on big projects, delivered results, and people I worked with still give me great recommendations.

As the company grew, I had good relationships with multiple CEOs and execs (and still do)—but when the newest batch of investment company selected executives came in, the culture completely changed.

When I was up for a promotion, I had leadership backing, but I didn’t get it. Later, I found out that at a leadership dinner, the new execs straight-up said I couldn’t be taken seriously in a more visible senior role because I wasn’t “in shape.” Apparently, to them, that meant I was not be committed to anything and did not value myself enough to be in leadership.

Oh, and I later learned there were four unofficial but understood requirements for leadership according to the new execs:
Be tall
Be white
Be a former athlete
Be in shape

I checked three out of four, but that last one was enough to keep me out of the cool—I mean cruel—kids club.

A few months later, layoffs happened. My boss was asked to cut someone and picked an employee who had already failed multiple performance improvement plans—but leadership shut that down and made them fire me instead. The official reason? I didn’t have a senior title. And I didn’t have a senior title because… well, we know why.

Not long after I was let go, my boss—the only non-white exec in leadership—was also let go.

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about how much tech has started feeling more like a boys’ club fitness cult than an industry that actually values intelligence and skill. And when people like Mark Zuckerberg start talking about how we need more “masculine energy” in business and tech, it’s not hard to see how that mindset trickles down into companies deciding that leadership should only “look” a certain way.

Anyway, just wanted to share my experience and see if others have dealt with the same thing.",user_800,1071,59

I get excited when I find out a new way to get better answers or discover a VS code extension to have free copilot on my machine  or seeing anaconda's new assistant doing so well in jupyter notebook so I don't have to keep going back and forth between windows and copy paste code lol

Even before these LLMs, I was still using google (well, stack overflow and documentations) to write code and fix issues. It just took me so much time because if one thing didn't work, I had to try another or tweak my search. One bug would take days to fix. Now, those same complicated bugs take like 30 minutes to fix. It still requires a lot of back and forth, but I don't have to go dig for something. I just have to tweak the question I have, explain things in more detail and think of creative ways to ask for test scenarios. 

I know it's awful that people use it to write essays, but as a teaching assistant, I was able to quickly notice any essay that was clearly written by AI. I know people use it to generate art, but the art looks soulless and fake. Deep fake is literally just that, fake. It's nowhere near human creativity. 

And it won't replace us. Because the moment humans stop creating data for it to learn from, it crashes. AI learning from AI generated text? Snake eating its own tail! 

So I don't understand the fear people have or the hate they have for these tools. They're amazing and they've made my life so much easier and I can't believe I spent so much time doing things without these tools. Like I could have been so much more productive with these at my disposal when I was an undergrad or even in graduate school. 

I get why people are scared of AI, but I don't know if I'm correct in thinking they don't need to be. Admittedly, my knowledge of LLMs is very surface level. But I still know more than 90% of regular people - I think? I at least know what attention is, how transformers work, what word embeddings are, I know it's not just creating things out of nowhere (""generative"") but guessing the next word based on probability...

I am a department head at a small startup that is made up of mostly engineers and where men out number women 5:1.  Women are also sprinkled across the company with basically every team having maybe 1 woman, which makes the gender imbalance feel even more severe than it is.  Despite this imbalance, I  naively thought that we were better than the other companies that I worked for in the past... companies where my voice hadn't been heard, where my ideas were overlooked,  where I was constantly being talked down to, and where I eventually quit out of frustration.  

After connecting with some women I don't usually overlap with in my role, I realized that I'd let my status as a leader cloud my perception of what other women at this company were experiencing.   I heard stuff  like ""no one listens to me so I don't bother speaking up anymore"" and reports of women's work being scrutinized more than their male counterparts... it seriously broke my heart and filled me with rage.

How do you deal with controlling peers?,"I feel genuinely creeped out by these types.  Folks who try to ""demonstrate ability to lead"" by getting others to follow their command.  Disrespectful af.

I usually ignore them or ask them to do it themselves or claim that I don't have time.  But sometimes they ask me to do a thing that I already volunteered to do.  Or things that are fully my job that I will definitely do without their command.

It always ruins things when someone demands that I do things that I've already taken initiative to do.  Because then I don't get credit for the work.  It was ""their idea"" and I am following.

Sometimes I disagree with the specific demand.  Like, it has the right motive, but it won't work and I cannot do it without consequences.  e.g. It's too risky and I prefer to accomplish the same goal a different way.  Or sometimes it's overkill and I don't have time.  Or sometimes it's just incorrect.  Sometimes it is out of scope for me.

This is leading to a lot of problems for me because sometimes management can't be on my side because they get tricked by these ICs.

They usually get management on their side by claiming to represent our core principles in some fashion.  And that they need to force us to abide by the principles.  As engineers we take pride in such things and they are also highly practical; so there is no need to force us to do these.  It is patronizing.

My previous manager told me that I didn't have to do anything ""assigned"" to me by said IC unless I had time.  So I never made time.  But my current manager gets tricked easily.

The worst is when they make a long speech with management in the room about our core principles and the reasons for doing a thing, then it makes it seem like not only do I need to be told what to do, but I am also lacking sense enough to do my job in a principled fashion.  And there isn't enough time left in the meeting or air left in the room to entertain any talkback from me.  And there're also too many other people in the meeting who are not interested in this discussion point at all and we have to respect their time.

They're always super nice coworkers.  Above and beyond.  So I'd be happy to help them if they ask.  But g-d.  Why must they demand things from me?  It makes me look like even more of a shit human for not giving into their demands.

I understand that it's a bit of a faux pas to call out disrespect or otherwise incorrect behavior; equivalent to getting emotional.  So I don't want to be too direct or passive aggressive about it.

I wish I could be a yes person.  I see others who are more chill and manage to engage them rationally without getting angry or looking stupid.

In the interest of building up my own career path, I've been reading Tanya Reilly's *The Staff Engineer's Path* and one of the things she mentions is creating a technical vision document for the company describing where the company or engineering team would ideally be after all the biggest problems were solved.

I sit on a small group of engineers that represent each of our company's development teams, so naturally I brought this idea up to them - seemed like the perfect exercise for a group who wants to guide the department and company in the right direction. Not only was the idea well received, but we spent a few sessions brainstorming a ton of key points and nuances to include, and I've gotten praise on the document I word-smithed from our brainstorms. Our cross-team group leader is even planning to bring it up the technical vision at a company-wide meeting. 

I'm not 100% sure what we're going to do with the document once it's ""ready"" (and it will be a while before it is, as it hasn't been circulated beyond our cross-team group), but I'm glad that people have bought into this. Especially because I'm always a little worried at being undermined as a woman, but I seem to have found a place of work where that's a strength, not an obstacle.",user_513,7,4

My name is Kaitlyn. I am 28 years old and sick and tired of dead end jobs.  I just got fired from a dispensary job and I have realized I am just over customer service and tired of having to be ""nice"" to everyone for a paycheck and realizing I am worth more than what society has conditioned me to believe about my worth.  I am from Illinois where John Deere was founded and while there's seemingly a lot of ""opportunities"" here on paper, this town is a shithole and a deadend for any opportunities in my opinion.  I just want to get on a plane and live in Portugal or New Zealand and work remotely but I realize I'm gonna need to develop skills to get there. 

I just got off the phone with an advisor from (UIC) University of Chicago and they offer a Data Analytics bootcamp for $12,995 and a $2,000 discount if I enroll early. I passed the assessment and felt really excited to start something new but I want to make an informed decision. I am trying to compare UIC to just being self taught through EDx or Udemy, Coursera etc. after watching some Youtube videos on it. 

I was given a free subscription for one year to take as many courses as I want on Edx.  So I have the chance to learn this for free anyways.  I am learning SQL and Excel sheets and just the basics rn. I was told by the UIC advisor that being self taught is harder and no guarantees of employment, even though their success rate in job placement is 78%. 

I just really could use some advice from other women in the field and could really use some encouragement since I am unemployed and I am scared and really don't know what is next. 

I asked the UIC advisor why Data Analytics is still worth it, since my friend who is a Backups Administrator for a tax consulting firm told me that most jobs in tech are being outsourced to India now at his job. So what is the point then? 👉  She answered with ""You have to always upscale and learn new things and be valuable and be irreplaceable. So she mentioned that Data Analytics would be a good start, and that the real opportunity is in AI Machine Learning. 

I am definitely open to learning AI and everything I can possibly know about it because I think its fascinating and it would offer me job security without needing a man for anything, which is my ultimate goal because in the past men have been very predatory towards me and this is a terrifying time to be alive as a woman. 

Any advice to offer me some sense of direction would be so appreciated and thank you for listening. 

Much love.

I (34F) work as a contractor with federal employees and have done so for the last 4 years. As you may have heard in the news, the first thing that 🍊did was to force government employees into the office five days a week and announce massive layoffs of federal employees across the country.

As a contractor, I can be affected at any time because unlike federal employees, our contract can be cancelled at any time for convenience and just like that, we are at risk for being out of a job. 

To say that this has been psychological warfare on everybody is an understatement. No one knows what kind of cuts are coming next and these drastic cuts means that a lot of excellent technologists will no longer do the work that they felt compelled to do for the country. 

I have been waking up every morning for the past month crying, having a panic attack, or both. I have been working in civic tech since the start of my career almost nine years ago and I have found this field to be the most psychologically safe place that I have ever been in my life, especially as a woman of color. 

Sure, I complain about some of the men that I work with, but I have learned so much from everybody and I have enjoyed building things that benefit the American people in a positive way. I am afraid to go back to startups and private industry because I have been scarred deeply by mansplainers, unsupportive management, and backstabbing by co-workers. At this point, it is very likely that I will be losing my job next month and I am in pre-mourning because I am scared of everything that is about to happen, what direction my career will to, and my overall mental health. 

If you have made it this far, thank you so much for reading. Again, I want people to know that the people that they are randomly firing really loved their jobs and the mission that they serve and do not deserve the way that they have been treated. If there are any grammatical errors in this, I apologize, but I am doing this wrong on the fly sobbing and scared. 

**UPDATE**: Thank you everyone for the empathy shown during all of this. I thought about making this an update to my original post, but decided to do it here because it is going to be rather long. 

To give you all a peek behind the curtains: people who worked at 18F got an email of reduction in force last night right before midnight. One of the projects that a lot of people will be impacted by was the IRS free e-file which gave those who make under $80,000 an option to file their taxes for free. To say that I am sad and angry is an understatement. Please [learn about their work](https://18f.gsa.gov/) while their website is still up. People who worked there cared more than meeting minimum requirements and we will be worse off. 

The thing with 18F was that they were cost recoverable meaning that the agency runs by a cost-recovery model meaning that they are funded by already funded agencies for their services meaning that they do not cost taxpayers any additional dollars. This was done so thoughtlessly and this was very unnecessary to do in the name of “saving the government money”

**I need to make correction**: IRS eFile is/was free for those making under $168,000, not $80,000",user_859,417,51

I’m a 26-year-old female with a 9-month-old daughter, currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My classes are online, allowing me to complete assignments from home (this is relevant for context).

Recently, I interviewed for a Software Support Specialist position. After going through three rounds of interviews, the final one really threw me off. Everything started normally—the interviewer asked about my resume, which is expected. But then, she asked, “What do you like to do in your free time?” I responded, “I enjoy spending time with my family and my daughter.” I can’t help but feel that my answer played a role in me not getting the job, which doesn’t seem fair.

Toward the end of the interview, she expressed hesitation about hiring me, saying, “You have a lot going on.” She then started asking personal questions, such as, “Who will take care of your daughter while you’re working?” I told her my husband would. She continued with, “What does he do for work? Does he take her to his job?” At that point, I felt like I had to justify personal aspects of my life that had nothing to do with my qualifications or ability to do the job.

I can’t understand why an employer should be so concerned with my childcare arrangements or personal life outside of work. If I’m applying for a job, it means I’m fully prepared to handle the responsibilities and make the necessary arrangements. I even assured her that I was available to work weekends and beyond regular hours when needed.

I understand employers are concerned about their employees availability but I reassured her multiple times that I have arrangements made. I think this raised a red flag about the company culture because why did I keep getting questioned about my personal life? If I said I made arrangements and I can handle it then that means I made arrangements and I CAN HANDLE MY PERSONAL LIFE. I have plenty of work experience and never once got fired. 

The pay is great but I felt so discriminated just because I have a child😔 and if I am applying that means I obviously thought everything through. Otherwise I wouldn’t be applying for a full-time role.
Am I wrong for feeling like this was inappropriate? Shouldn’t the focus be on my skills and experience rather than my personal circumstances?

I think I'm wrong.,"I'm trying to move up into a better tech job... after realizing I'm already working in tech. I didn't take action on upskilling or networking because I felt tech was *evil*, that networking was sleazy, that the entire system needed to be burnt to the ground. I started to unlearn these beliefs, but they've been stubborn. It's always a voice in my head telling me this. I realize this belief doesn't serve me in getting a better job and income, which I realize I actually do care about. I'd talk to this with my therapist, but we don't have our next appointment until Monday.

I know this belief doesn't serve me. I need help overcoming it.

I think I'm obsessed with not doing harm and it's preventing me from taking action. I really think this is Harm OCD. I know this because I had the same problem in relationships and friendships, because teenage me was actively harmful to others! I think this is also my ""strong sense of justice"" getting in the way. Internally, she'd like nothing more than to have an easy, steady job, doing good for other people, not feeling like she needs to compete, that getting and advancing in the career was completely merit based. This really isn't true, especially outside of non-profits and the public sector.

I don't know where this belief started, but I know it was reinforced by 2008 financial crash. I was 16 when it happened, and I hated the people who seemingly ruined the economy for the sake of their own greed. I fell into increasingly doomer rabbit holes, the most notable being the Peak Oil/Life After the Oil Crash Community. There was this feeling of ""I'm not evil! I'm going to do good and this system is going to be burnt to the ground!"". I associate the idea of ""providing value"" in a very zero sum way, like it's causing harm to people's finances, health, or the environment. ""I provide value by denying cancer claims"" or the like.

I picked urban planning as my major because I felt like it was the space where I was doing the most to make society better and stop ""the harm"". I didn't get an urban planning job because of severe ADHD getting in the way of projects and social anxiety making me afraid to network in college. I fell off the train and got a job doing GIS work for a FAANG company... which I've been stuck at because of a lot of personal issues. The ""This system is evil and is going to be burnt to the ground"" continued, but now in leftist flavor.

During my time in college, I remember the political communities I were a part of looking down on tech companies. (despite the fact a lot of us worked in tech) It was 2015, the tech bro was the newest public enemy. Uber and whatever self-driving car companies were saying they were the future of transportation while actively undermining public transportation (the actual solution to the problem). Some tech CEO was promoting gondolas as Austin's transportation solution over, say, light rail. On the flip side, me and a bunch of activists pushed to get light rail on the ballot in 2016. This is just one example of many.

I think these beliefs were waning in me in recent years, but then the 2024 election happened and so many Silicon Valley billionaires went all out for Trump. Now I feel icky about, say, the role social media has had in our society and how social media was a big driver for the growth of tech in the 2010s. Like, I want the money, but I don't want to make things worse. I want to work at a company that's like... not evil and right wing. I want to be able to network and do work in tech without having to help construct The Torment Nexus.

Right before I wrote this post, I realized this idea of evil was very abstract, very big picture. Somehow I lost track of the smaller ways harm in perpetuated in this industry. The harassment, the discrimination, the boys club. I've not done that, and I feel like it's not hard to... treat people with kindness. I don't know about the big picture, but I feel cozy knowing I act with kindness in the spaces I work in.

I have to remind myself there's BIG difference between tech workers and the big tech billionaires or SV venture capitalists. The former are generally good people who care about the work they do. The latter lost their minds during COVID, radicalized themselves, went right-wing, and their work is more of financier than engineer. I'm probably getting most of my networking contacts with other engineers. Recommendations for good companies are always appreciated!

This was a bit of a ramble. I hope there are people here who've had the same feelings, especially if they were also emotionally affected by 2008. I want to overcome this black-and-white thinking, and I appreciate your perspective!",user_1065,19,16

Sometimes I still pinch myself because none of it feels real. Tiny accomplishments that at the time felt laughably inadequate slowly added up over the years and sometimes I still can't believe where I am.

Some background on me now: I have about 9 years of experience as a Software Engineer. First 4-5 years was fullstack, since then have specialized in backend bordering on data engineering. I have attended two coding bootcamps, finished a Software Engineering degree while working full time, mentored underrepresented people in tech, earned a patent for my work, and studied for various certs (A+, Network+, Project+, PMP, ITIL Foundation + Intermediate, maybe even one more I'm forgetting idk). I made Lead with only 3 years of experience, promoted off cycle in < year at that job. Within 2 years went from ""broke as a joke"" to making enough money on one income to buy a home in my low/medium cost of living city. I was at \~180 TC from year three onwards. Currently > 350k at a FAANG-esque place.

If that all sounds cool, I promise you that it didn't feel that way at the time. My entry into tech was marked by a series of failures, embarrassments, slights, and disappointments.

**A truly terrible start**

When I first decided to change careers my entrance test for <fancy bootcamp> was so abysmal that they didn't even give me platitudes about trying to apply again in the future. The less-prestigious bootcamp I eventually did join, I flunked the first unit (along with about half the other students) and we were split up with me and the other kids that got 'held back a grade'. I worked my butt off to improve and eventually drifted to at least the middle of the pack, but it was clear my instructors thought I'd never be a Real Engineer (TM), after our last unit they counseled me about fonts and design resources as if it weren't designed to be a full stack program.

Months drifted on. I had what would have been a menial job offer me a 35k offer to work with their ancient technology. When I very politely tried negotiating they rescinded the offer.

I choked in fibonacci code tests. I floundered in phone screens. My resume content was a train wreck even though I'm better at most than writing resumes, my background was laughable. The main section was a careful curation of half-truths meant to disguise my lack of technical experience. A euphemistically titled ""Education/Training"" subsection was meant to carefully obscure that I had no degree.

My only job leads were dysfunctional or humiliating.

One hyper-aggressive tiny startup surprised me with their interest, only to have the CIO call me directly and launch into what felt like an interrogation. After invasively asking about my high school graduation date and deducing that I'd taken some old jobs off my resume, he berated me for not including things like a stint as a waitress at 18 years old because ""it was part of my life and here at S@#$ Startup we like to hire REAL. PEOPLE"", that they had former waiters and bartenders and zookeepers on staff! I told him I had been told to curate my resume towards my current goals, which he scoffed at (??? like what).

He called back after the conversation to say while I was too inexperienced to hire, they could take me on for an unpaid internship. I politely told him that I needed to prioritize a role with pay/health insurance and he interrogated me again, saying ""Aren't you out of work now? Don't you currently not have health insurance?""

I got desperate because I needed money. Another startup, a darling in my area, interviewed me and made me take a Myers Briggs type test, I am convinced I got rejected because I was not an ideal type match for my boss. (MBTI is BS by the way and made up by an unqualified racist, which I did not learn until after that experience).

At one interview for a different company, they asked enough pointed questions to realize I had no degree, and one interviewer reacted as if I had cartoon stink lines coming off me. Embarrassed, I explained that I'd paused my education to deal with a critically ill parent. ""We're sorry to hear that, how is he?"" they asked. ""Dead"", I had to hollowly recount. *What was the purpose of any of this, just reject me* I thought. They did.

Although apparently whatever they thought of my credentials, they hated everyone else's more. Two months later they called back and asked if I was still interested. As a nonprofit they had strict position requirements and let me know they had to specially reissue the job to hire such an uneducated street urchin as me. They also were careful to note that although the original posting was a web/db role, they would actually need me doing design, and was I sure I was OK being in that lane. It was an education & training team full of PhDs. I got to join with the distinction of being the most uneducated person in the education department. I made 54k.

I started at the same time as two other entry level men. They seemed pleasantly surprised with my performance. Six months into the job any pride I had at doing well was completely deflated when I found an old message board post from my team's manager advising the team about me and two other entry level hires I started with. The two guys were introduced by their interests and I was introduced as ""weak with databases but with decent design capabilities"", someone they could give supposedly less technical design work to.

Most weeknights and almost every weekend, I coded. I was too bad at it to do most tutorials even without getting stuck. When I would get too tired and frustrated to keep trying to build portfolio projects, I'd do codeacademy for muscle memory.

The nonprofit decided that I was capable enough to do non-design after all, and threw me heavily into SQL and relational databases. That place was a joke, but I had no idea what a gift they were giving me with a world class introduction to SQL. My direct boss made it clear he did not approve of my lack of degree and feeling pressured I resumed classes. I started with pre-calc, my first math class in 10 years scraping by with only a D, adding to the daily feelings of inadequacy and stupidity.

I remember the point it changed though. After all that work. It was a little bit after a year in. Instead of terror at ambiguous tasks or obscure SQL, some little voice in me started to know: *I can do this. I can do all of it. I can do whatever they throw at me.*

I worked and in my free time coded, over and over and over. A year and a half passed, and after many failed attempts to get away from the dumb nonprofit I got the opportunity that would change my life: A role using modern/in-demand technologies at a late stage startup with lovely culture, where I would learn modern frameworks, be paid fairly, and grow beyond my wildest dreams.

The rest is like a dream sequence.

**Things getting good**

The next job I got, I swear the recruiter misheard or misnoted my salary ask ""1-1-5"" as ""1-5-5"". I got 155 base and \~25/year equity. I had 2 years exp at that time. I live in a LCOL/MCOL city and assumed they must have adjusted my pay to west coast wages.

My manager was a rogue code contributor who had written our entire no-ORM API as a SQL injection nightmare, and built a new ETL application in Python 2 as he didn't know about system python (2 was slotted to be sunsetted already at that point, another security nightmare of a decision by him). With my accidental(?) high salary I was sure any day I'd be fired as inadequate, but never dreamed of not accepting the role as it doubled my salary. *I will do anything required for them to see me as worth the 155 they are paying*, I said to myself.

I dealt with the ambiguity of his terrible technical decisions by taking over everything. My manager was gruff and unfriendly and micromanagerey, and to avoid him I took over sole development of a microservice style frontend, backend & API + separate ETL system, as well as maintenance for 9 VMs that made up our different microservice deployments + dev/staging. And that friends is how with just \~3 years experience I received an off-cycle title bump to ""Lead Developer"".

If there is one through-note that led me to my success now, that's the only thing I can attribute it to. Some little voice inside saying **""I will become whatever is required. I will do whatever is required. I will do whatever it takes until I am undeniable""**.

I started making near \~200k. I finished my software engineering degree as a full time student, with a 4.0 major GPA. I received a patent for something I wrote. I redesigned an ETL system producing something like 1000x performance improvement (not kidding, it was written terribly the first time by an intern). I became even more specialized in databases. I became something of an expert in the way concurrency works in my main language. I wound up at a FAANG-esque employer.

I did a second bootcamp, this one focused on advanced algorithms which I'd always dreaded and sucked at. Despite never doing the ""Leetcode grind"", to my shock I was good all the sudden? I tested out of several sections of curriculum before even studying the bootcamp's material. I'd go to group sessions for algo problems and be the first one with not only an answer, an ideally optimized answer. Who tf was this person? Was I always able to be this way?

The answer is clearly ""No"", I legitimately used to suck. All I had was hard work and belief in myself. Zero talent. Work + belief were enough, apparently.

My income jumped to over \~350k. The more money I made the better I was treated. Toxic workplaces and low pay from earlier in my life faded into the rearview. Projects within my team started fighting over my time. Other teams called me in to consult on database scaling and design.

I stopped having to try very hard to be right, or to write good code, or design good systems. I'd long ago stopped needing to do side projects to bolster my skills.

It is hilarious to me in hindsight how hard everyone earlier in my career tried telling me I was ""just"" capable of doing design, like it was some lesser thing. The funny thing about it is a) design is HARD! b) I am VERY bad at it c) I am actually uniquely GOOD at big data pipelines and relational databases. It seems obvious in retrospect that all that came from ""design is female coded/design is lesser/you are female coded therefore lesser and a design person"". (To my friends in design, it is such BS and I'm sorry you face it).

I suffered immensely those first few years with imposter syndrome, and honestly some paralysis in response to it when trying to get work done. The only thing that helped me through, through figuring out complicated system design or a weird bug was to start small. ""What's one thing I can prove? What's one thing I can disprove? What's one small behavior loop I can get this code to do?"". Compared with people I know who have dropped out of coding, I feel like emotional resilience/regulation may have been the skill that got me further than any technical ones.

**Parting thoughts**

I wrote this because someone asked, which I thought was very touching. I'm no one from nowhere special, and it surprises me that anyone would even care to hear it. The reason I thought about it more and decided to honor their request is in case there is anyone out there who feels like I felt. I can't promise things in tech will work out the same, I may have caught the last gasp of a dying era of frenzied growth.

I know it isn't fair for people who weren't as lucky. I was a hard worker, but money is a circumstance. I caught a stampeding cascade of lucky dominos in the luckiest chain reaction of my life. I had no education. I could barely code a fizzbuzz at first (god, I remember being so happy the first time I succeeded).

I'm luckier than I dreamed I'd be in a million years. And maybe its a moment, and it will pass. That may be likely. Money is a circumstance, it can come and go. It isn't something I'd like to let change me or who I am as a person if I can help it.

I feel like the truest me will always still be the girl that turned in my mess of a first bootcamp project with the dramatic pronouncement, ""I have to tell you up front, not a thing about this works"". So for anyone out there that that is you right now, just know that those messy moments can be the first inch of a long winding path that takes you wonderful places.",user_799,75,14

Details:

I used to work in web development -- in fact, worked in it for the last decade.  But it's getting harder and harder for me to find a job in that field. In fact, I've been looking for a job for the last two years.  I'm one of the old guard, so my knowledge is pretty outdated. The fact that I don't know React is working against me.  Since I couldn't find a job, I started my own web dev company which grew to five full time salaried employees.  Over time, I realized my heart wasn't in web dev.  I also noticed contracts out there beginning to dry up, with it getting harder and harder to find contracts.  So I successfully exited the company with a profit.

But now I'm in a quandary. I can't find another job -- I know this because of having searched for one for two years with no luck, which is why I'm immensely grateful my company was able to keep me afloat during those two years of searching.  Now that the company's been closed down, I find myself needing another opportunity.  At the moment, I'm currently a dorm counselor in a school for the deaf to keep the lights on.  I do have the profits from when I exited the company, but nearly every cent of it will go to taxes, leaving me with nothing.  Which is why I'm working as a dorm counselor in Salem, Oregon which is where I live.  Doesn't pay much, but it's something. I'm also a grad student studying at University of Oregon in Portland working on my executive MBA because I figured maybe there's opportunities in management.

But the more I work on my degree and watch politics and the economy, the more I'm starting to realize opportunities will be limited in management for me. Especially given that I'm deaf.  Additionally, I feel like the fact I'm a 43 year old deaf woman single parent of two young kids is working against me.

After doing some research, it seems the most stable remote jobs are in DevOps and some other fields.  DevOps does interest me.  I have a server in where I'm hosting 35 paying clients (all clients who contracted with me to either develop or maintain their websites over the years). It generates about $820/month in residual income.  I'm finding myself enjoying maintaining the server and supporting the clients with provisioning and maintaining infrastructure, and automating workflows on the server to support custom websites. So I'm looking to get into DevOps.

I know that my age, disability, and gender are working against me, but I don't want to give up hope.  If there's anyone out there willing to be a mentor, or know of any entry level DevOps jobs out there with ethical companies in where my disability and gender won't play a factor against me, please let me know -- I'd love a lifeline.",user_1456,2,4

I've enjoyed this sub very much and now I'm in need of some guidance. 

I'm being moved to a different team in my company, it's a bit of a bummer but if I'm being honest, it will be good for my mental health. 

My soon to be old boss, was a toxic micromanager. It was getting better but only because I was doing a ton of leg work to keep him in line and protect myself. It was exhausting. 

The new team, I think I can do great work on. It's not the same work but it's in the same realm and I think there will be upward mobility there. 

To my question: How can I let go of all my hurt feelings from my old boss so I don't bring it into the new team? Mainly, I have imposter syndrome like I've never had it before and I used to be super curious about work and over the last 3 years became afraid to go beyond what was exactly asked of me. 

I don't want to be that person anymore. 

Bonus question: If y'all have some good tips on things I can ask my new boss to sus out their style and how I will fit into their team, that would be great.

1iy2z37,2025-02-25 19:07:40 ,womenintech,https://www.reddit.com/r/womenintech/comments/1iy2z37/boyfriend_got_a_job_offer_at_my_work_his/,"Boyfriend got a job offer at my work, his entitlement over it has stunned me","**TL:DR my current partner got an offer at my work lower than what he expected and was very upset about it**, going so far as to say he no longer felt like coming in and going ""above and beyond"" for the role I referred him to. The offer was still super generous and would have him in the 97th percentile of earners in this country. The difference in entitlement level has me reeling.

**Acronyms in this story:**  
*FAANG*: prestigious tech companies known for great pay/hard interviews  
*URM*: under represented minorities, tech is very white and male.  
*ESPP*: a stock purchase program your company can offer you to get discounted stock  
*RSU*: restricted stock units sometimes given as employee bonuses basically, at companies like mine sometimes they are worth more than your salary  
*L4*: the job level my role seniority is with my work's system of labor categories, a ""Senior Engineer"" in my case, his too  
*TC*: Total compensation, equity + base pay + bonuses etc. Among high-earning tech people used to figure out how much we ""really"" make since equity is a lot of it

**Background:** I used to work at <small company> which got acquired by <prestigious company, near FAANG level> after I left. (Think something like Microsoft, well known, fairly valuable stock, although it isn't them its that kind of ballpark except WAY better pay). In the time since, my career has thrived - I made Lead in 3 years, went back to school and finished a degree in Software Engineering, my work has received a patent, I've mentored URM in tech, I'm a paid freelance writer for tech companies and been interviewed on tech podcasts and done endless work on side projects in my free time to advance my career. I have \~9 years experience as a SW Eng, \~12 in tech total.

Over the years I've kept in touch with <small company coworkers> and they've all loved the new company, during that time the stock has also blown up. I've had an eye on them over the years and once even applied for the software project I built for the small company, which <prestigious company> kept going (to my surprise)! I included the detail in my cover letter and everything but got rejected anyway which I found so funny.

In late 2023 after repeated complaints about a boss's gender bias, I was laid off (womp womp) but got a good severance because of how fishy the circumstances were + I got a lawyer. I used the money to attend an algorithm/interview prep program for software engineers and worked REALLY hard. In 2024, after EIGHT TOTAL interviews for this single job, I finally received an incredible offer from <prestigious company> and have been there ever since.

**The current issue**: My partner has wanted a new job ever since we started dating. I've referred him to several positions at my work. Recently one of them called him back and after four interviews, they told him they wanted to make him an offer. They had an internal candidate filling the role but were able to get additional headcount to hire him too.

I had given some general advice on what I thought he might get from the offer and he also had been consulting Blind, Glassdoor etc so had some expectations. He has a little more experience than me (12 years) but a non-engineering degree, and nowhere near as prolific in his side projects etc. His niche *maybe* pays a little less. My company is aware that they are very in-demand right now and seem to have adjusted packages across the board as a result.

His offer comes in, and his base is 4k less than mine, his equity is about half. He negotiates his base up to 5k higher than mine, but the equity doesn't move much. Although, he also gets beneficial conditions because of some stuff they changed with our ESPP program, first year vesting, and he also has a skewed vesting schedule (40% year one, mine is just 25%). The base is 50k higher than his current pay, TC 120k/year higher.

This man was...*mad*. He was mad he didn't get more equity. He'd couch the remarks with ""I know overall its a great opportunity but..."" then keep ranting. Initially I sympathized with him, I said maybe it was budget stuff because of the extra headcount, maybe it was because of how the stock value has gone up so much, I sympathize that his niche in tech is maybe slightly undervalued compared to mine. I was empathetic to a point.

But then I got really angry when he kept ranting on and on about it. When he said he wasn't going to go ""above and beyond"" anymore, realizing someone I put my name on the line for was coming into the opportunity of a lifetime with a chip on their shoulder was infuriating. So many URM would have killed for this opportunity. Heck, this company is so hard to get into they've rejected me for a job working on SOFTWARE I WROTE! It is not easy to get into. I had to do *twice as many interviews* as him to get it, I paid 10k for an interview prep program to get it. The job he got even got filled by the internal hire, so like what *phenomenal luck* they could even GET extra headcount to hire him! The ESPP changes, the preferential vesting, like there is SO. MUCH. GOOD. About this opportunity.

To see a white guy basically revile an offer that the URM I've mentored in tech would kill for just felt like such a slap in the face. I'm pretty direct so I told him how upset I was to hear this, that I wish I'd never even referred him and saved my effort and influence for one of those people who would actually appreciate it instead of turn their nose up at it. **This could have changed someone else's life**.

I'm still in shock over the level of entitlement.

A friend asked me if I'd feel the same as he did if the situation was reversed and I was in his position, and I could say 100% no. The whole time I was in my offer process I prepared myself for every worst outcome, low base, no equity, because I'm so used to having to fight for every little inch of progress. I actually even did have a parallel. My recruiter explained the stock price for my equity in a misleading way so tl:dr I originally thought I'd get something like 2x as much. Of course I had my small moment of ""oh that stinks"" but moved on almost immediately. I can't imagine behaving that way. It just reiterated to me how differently we exist in tech.

**\[Edits for the comments\]**

**This is now an ex bf, for those commenting on that front**

I'm very upset about this incident but don't want to be unfair here, so: more detail on bf. First, he has apologized - numerous times. He says he was just ""processing feelings"" about his surprise at the details of the offer. He is generally very progressive, and in the past has publicly bragged on me making 2x what he does. I would not consider him threatened by me in that way, at least not consciously. He often tells me he thinks I'm better at him at all this stuff, although it isn't really comparable (different specialties) so whatever. I've also earned more than him the whole time we have been dating basically and I don't feel like he's been toxic about it.

I do think it is plausible that his expectations were based on the past \~year of TC details posted on Blind etc, so I understand his surprise and was also surprised that the company is pulling back on stock so much, our offers are < year apart.

His idea of ""above and beyond"" also was like, working weekends etc. I told him that isn't our workplace culture and he shouldn't have been planning to do that anyway. Even so, his frustration and phrasing around it sounded like someone with an axe to grind when given an amazing chance and rubbed me so the wrong way.

It was not a ""lowball offer"" whatsoever. Well above industry average, and a 75% increase in his annual comp. Using an income calculator, his annual comp would put him at pay above 97% of people in this country. That's what I'm talking about when I say how jarring and out of touch this reaction was.

Some of y'all are asking in a rather uncharitable way why I didn't get an URM this job. I have mostly mentored remotely, people all over the country, so generally people not adjacent to HQ or remote offices. My company is VERY remote-friendly but they do mostly try to hire around the hubs so someone could come in occasionally (like monthly). In the case of this specific job, as non-diverse as tech is this niche within it is even LESS diverse. I don't know if I even know any URM with this specialty. I think my work is great and have been recommending everyone I know and encouraging URM I know to keep an eye on the jobs because it is a great place. Its a huge company, and I know a lot of people - I cannot realistically stay on top of every job we have and act as a part-time recruiter for every URM in tech I know",user_799,1092,291

They sent her a rejection email telling her that she was not qualified enough. 

Well today we interviewed a man using that same interview process who did very poorly on the two tests.  The first one I guess you could conceivably say he passed but he got a lot of help and didn't hit all the objectives. But the second one he didn't even come close to passing.  But you know what? He was a white guy and he was very personable and the tech lead I interviewed him with said that he thought he probably could do better than he showed us.

Of course it irked me, but I wasn’t interested in calling out some guy not even in our company.

It’s been a month now since I was elevated and I’m now running the meetings consistently. For the first time, he apologized for greeting only the men in the room. He said “I’ve probably said “hello gentlemen” for the last 8 or 9 meetings and that didn’t acknowledge you. I’m sorry and I need to be better at that.”

Honestly I was shocked and try to laugh it off by saying I was used it, but I have to admit I was not expecting this. I want to credit this white boomer for his self awareness, but I don’t know if someone tipped him off. 😂 it’s obviously sad that I had to become the face of the meeting for him to acknowledge me but I’d like to believe there was reflection and growth for him from this experience.

My personal experience has been in line with what I have seen in this sub, many women I have worked with have been substantially underpaid for their competence level. I’ve encouraged and even vouched for these women in past work places and at one point got the members of a team a raise telling my wage for negotiation purposes and advocating for them. I’m fairly good at advocating for myself so I’ve often wondered why these women who were so competent weren’t being recognized. But now I’ve gone back to college in my 30’s and in many ways when looking for internships if my interviewer is a women they are pleasant but I can’t help feeling that I am missing the “connection” I try to be personable but the reactions I get are a mix of genuine conversation and the occasional vibe of an unwanted advance like you were approaching a woman at a bar. I hope that makes sense. I don’t want to make the conversation negative so I will ask the question another way. What are the best communications or approaches you have seen from a man that made you feel respected as a source of information and for your competence? How personal should I be and do you have any suggested guard rails that might be useful for these opening conversations with recruiters?

Furthermore I promise to only use anything you tell me for good, ie I will continue to support and encourage women wherever I work. I understand this is a women’s space but I just couldn’t think of a better place to get insight I hope you can appreciate that but I could also understand a flat out ban. I just want to be better at this and I’m finding it frustrating to not get feedback directly I’m not the best cue reader and I won’t pretend to be great at making insights on others minds either, any help would be appreciated.

I’ve worked here for almost 5 months now, and most people have started after me. The vibes in general are okay, but being the only non-man is still slightly depressing, and even though there’s only the sporadic (maybe once a day) dick joke, being the only non-man makes me actually not want to go to work. It’s not necessarily sexism, not at all, more the way they work; focused like 100% of the time, taking just a 15min break stuffing their faces with lunch, and obviously working more with each other than they do with me.  
  
I’m working on an internal product with two colleagues, both men, and I’ve noticed how much of the work they do without me. They work and speak almost exclusively to each other during the day, and I’ve even seen messages later in the night between them in our group chat, at like 9PM. Commits in our git history from both of them at that time too. I know that might just be the “startup life” but I like my work-life balance, I actually have a life outside work, but they make me feel as if I shouldnt? This means that obviously I ask them almost every day if they can update me about work they did without me, but they always brush it off and dont really answer. This means I feel like half of the time I dont know whats going on, which makes me feel “dumb” (even though I have better degrees than they do, yes, I shouldnt compare but anyways) when I work with them. Also, when our CTO asks us about what we’re doing, I always struggle answering because I feel like only they really know the answer.  
  
I’m not sure what I can do about this. I’ve tried bringing it up with them, being open, but theyre not too responsive. Our CTO encourages an open culture very much, so im pretty sure I could bring it up with him but, again, that makes me feel like I’d be admitting I’m actually “dumber”/“doing less work than my colleagues”/&c.  
  
Can you give me any advice? I really love being in AI, especially this startup, since we’re doing generative AI, which has many overlaps with my own creative endeavors. I don’t want to leave, cause I’m pretty sure there’s no company like this anywhere close to me (its literally a 10min bike ride away from where I live), and I know they want to give me the opportunities that I’m looking for (generative music, basically). Any help would be appreciated. ",user_1462,0,4

* **Rosalind Franklin** – Her work on Photograph 51 was key to discovering DNA’s double helix, but she was overlooked for the Nobel.
* **Chien-Shiung Wu** – Proved the Parity Law wrong in physics, yet the Nobel went to her male colleagues.
* **Lise Meitner** – Discovered nuclear fission but was ignored for the prize.
* **Mary Allen Wilkes** – Wrote the software for LINC, one of the first personal computers, in her **own home!**
* **Valentina Tereshkova** – The first woman in space, but few people remember her name.

I came across an Etsy store celebrating these women with really cool designs. If you're into beautifully designed science shirts or non-ugly looking nerdy shirts, check it out! Amazing!

Some of my ideas/things I used to be involved in:
- ML data annotation/output review - I enjoyed it, but there were always more people than projects, so you couldn't reliably earn consistent amounts
- Video captioning - they paid peanuts for the amount of work and reviewing you had to do
- Technical writing - this one would be the most enjoyable for me, but it seems like very few blogs are actually willing to pay for articles instead of ""giving you exposure""
- Consulting - it might be me not being involved enough in this domain, but I haven't seen much demand for this lately. The only opportunities I've seen are either voluntary or can only pay you in equity (and not a lot)
- Own apps/products - this venue seems very appealing to me, but I'm hearing lots of clashing opinions, with recent app store policy changes making it harder for solo developers to publish on Google Store

I got a job offer at a place that works on custom software, including AI applications. The job and perks all seem really good but I'm having doubts about the AI aspect of things. Personally, while I do see AI has its uses, I guess I just have trouble seeing how AI (the type I'll be working on at least) is making the world a better place. Sure, things are getting more efficient, but I feel there should be a point where we are ""efficient enough"" so to speak and should focus on other things. I don't feel letting AI take over any and all human labor would be good because people worked hard to learn those skills. I personally feel a bit mixed emotions over co-pilot for example: it saves me a headache regularly but it also makes me feel like playing a game with cheatcodes enabled and the challenge is gone.

So, I feel like me taking this job might result in others losing theirs because I automated them away. Which is often the case with software, but this feels different. The job is a good learning opportunity as I only have a few years of work experience, but in the future I do want to work on more societally beneficial things and I worry that taking this job ruins my credibility for working on ""responsible"" tech. On the other hand I feel there's no sure way to pick a software company that won't employ AI  at some point, as things are changing so quickly? So in that sense, what's the point of not taking this offer.

Anyway. Sorry for a bit of a word salad.. but I hope you get the dilemma. How do you view this / have you refused jobs over this, would you refuse such a job? What do you think is the (future) impact of AI applications? Thanks for reading anyway. ",user_1464,2,9

I'm graduating at the end of April with an IT Services Diploma. I've realized cybersecurity is one of the fields I'm most interested in, but I also realize it's a more difficult field to get into at entry level. As a side note, my current cybersec course is prepping us for Security+, so I hope to get that cert soon after grad. 

I applied to a 3-month internship posting for a cybersecurity analyst. I saw the hourly pay which seems decent enough, but missed further down where it says the pay is in company shares. 

I got accepted to the next stage of the process, but I don't know if it's a bad idea to go through it with this payment style. They say they are fast-growing startup heading into an ""IPO endeavor"". 

Worst case I guess I end up being free labour for 3 months. Which would suck, but my partner would be able to financially support us for that long. I'm currently working part-time in a student co-op help desk position, so I at least have some income. I also have no idea if I'll actually manage to get a regular paying job soon after grad anyways, so I guess it's free training if nothing else? Looks good on a resume maybe? 

Or is it better to not risk things and hold out for another opportunity? Has anyone had experience taking a position like this? The company has high ratings on Glass Door, but people also mention they rely on unpaid interns.

I know that the way they were chosen was not based in transparent criteria, maybe one it was because of budget cuts which I would understand, but the other I don't. 

For me this is just a job that pays the bills. I know I am not a rock star or super smart. But I get extremely annoyed by their incompetence. I get annoyed for having to repeat the same things again and again, for writing everything detailed and still have them waste my time with useless calls whose conclusion is ""so I will read what I wrote"". 

I am doing my bachelor in Software Eng in parallel and had a situation of a group assignment in which other colleagues were not doing their part. At first they spoke a lot and immediately volunteered to take the lead but then booked useless meetings. Useless because they went to the meeting without even reading the instructions of what was required. I just ended up asking the professor to do the rest of the assignment alone because I was too pissed. Again I generally do not take this too seriously but that pissed me off so much!

Maybe its because I was in their position and I was able to perform ok without any help, and it annoys me the fact that they have all this privilege by being male (it is usually men I think I only had one instance with a woman) and still manage to suck. I feel like they should grow up and get out of my way. 

I am generally compassionate with other people struggles. Even at the political level I tend to align with policies that take into account that not everyone comes from the same starting point (usually its women or people from lower class, which I am, that start behind). However I don't seem to have the patience to deal with it on a personal level. Why? I do not understand this. In fact, should I even care to be compassionate? Because it seems sometimes what gets the prize is being cut throat (though that probably only works for men, for women we just get called the b word lol and I also generally despise the competition that capitalism and corporate puts people through)

* The job position simply just evaporates before the interview is done due to ""changing priorities"".
* The hiring team is all smiles, remark that I've given great answers, and seem genuinely excited to work with me and tell me I should expect to hear about next steps soon.

I tried different things to find my interest and eventually landed on UX/UI design, thinking it would be a good career path. But breaking into the field was incredibly hard.I kept getting rejected in later rounds, the pay was abysmal, and most so-called “UX/UI” jobs were just companies looking for someone to design social media posts for ₹10K ($120) a month. I even did a virtual internship through Forage, but it wasn’t real-world experience, and I had no proof from my previous company that I ever worked there.

My home environment was getting toxic because I was unemployed, and out of desperation, I started applying for anything. I took a sales job, which turned out to be miserable, but within a month, I got an offer in Mumbai with double the pay in the same role. So I left, hoping money would solve my problems.

Now, my previous company is refusing to give me my relieving letter or pay for the days I worked, even though my offer letter clearly said the notice period applied only after probation (which I was still in). They’re twisting things now, and I have no idea what to do.

Meanwhile, I hate sales, but I’m stuck because I have rent to pay, and there’s a bond, so I can’t leave easily. On top of that, this company makes us work Saturdays and sometimes Sundays, and I’m mentally exhausted.

That being said, the onboarding wasn’t the best, there wasn’t really a knowledge base and there wasn’t a structure/procedure when it comes to tasks for analytics since they didn’t have someone in house for an entire year. 

My boss told me my second week that she regretted hiring me and that I was asking too many questions, I was yelled at during meetings, I was excluded and just overall treated badly. I often felt like a consultant as opposed to being part of the team. There was also politics going on between product management and digital marketing where they didn’t like one another (I got in trouble with product team for helping out digital marketing but it is my job to do so?). 

I was rarely thanked for anything I did, belittled all the time, and when I complained to HR for workplace harassment, initially they seemed ""understanding"" but they eventually let me go. 

Before I left, one of my coworkers literally told me ""can you teach us how to do your job?” I often wonder, if I were a man of a different ethnicity and age, would they have treated me this poorly?

Nothing quite sets the mood like the gentle aroma of fermented piss, rotting debris and whatever the hell people flush down their toilets. It’s the ambiance of dreams.

But apparently it was romantic enough for my coworker.

I’m a 28 straight F, sewer and drains apprentice. Which means I get the glamorous jobs. I moonlight as a bartender. I'm not a model but not unattractive either. That makes me very much used to some grey area encounters. I also tried stand up for a couple years (not very good). More misogyny in the clubs than the bars it turns out. Who would have thought? Imagine being the only woman at one of those Joe Rogan round table episodes where the boys sit around being hilariously gross and awful on purpose. Not far off. 

That week's main job: crawling into a sewer line to check for blockage. It’s hot and nasty the only thing standing between me and the drkest depths of human waste is a pair of rubber boots and my ability to disassociate. But I’m not alone. I'm with a guy a year younger than me down there, also an apprentice, and weirdly confident for someone whose entire body currently smells like a public park restroom.

It started with some weak sauce: Man, it’s rare to see a girl doing this kinda work.

Wow, thanks for noticing. I hadn’t heard that before. So original.

Then it was: bet you’re tough though, huh? Like, one of those chicks who doesn’t mind getting dirty. Yep. I’m literally waist-deep in sewage right now. Pretty sure the time for minding passed about three clogged drains ago. But I laughed it off, because whatever, right? Guys say dumb stuff. But then as we’re wedged together in a pipe just big enough for two people to awkwardly coexist, he gets bold. He starts leaning in, says something about how ""we should get to know each other better"".I make a joke about how I really don’t date men who smell like biohazards. He laughed a bit so small W?

And then - because this situation wasn’t already perfect he tries to kiss me.

Just full-on leans in like this is some kind of underground romance novel and not the worst possible place to make a move on a coworker. And I? I reacted the way any sane person would.

I shoved him. Not hard—just enough to remind him that I have elbows and I will use them.

And then came the look. You know the one. The what’s the big deal look. The “I was just joking, why are you freaking out?"" look. As if attempting to stick your tongue down someone’s throat while you both marinate in liquefied garbage is just a casual misunderstanding.

We finished the job in silence. Back at the truck, he says: you don’t have to be weird about it.

Oh, I’m so sorry, sir. Let me go ahead and not be weird about the fact that you tried to make out with me in an underground swamp of human filth. That was totally normal, right? Just another day at work.

Here’s the thing, I’m used to dealing with guys like this. I know how to brush it off, laugh when I need to, keep things from escalating. But now I have to work with this guy. In close quarters. And I’m pissed. Do I report this and risk getting labeled ""overdramatic""? Do I suck it up and pretend it didn’t happen? What happens when we get sent out together again?

Curious what you would do. Or if anyone else has ever had the privilege of being harassed in a setting this truly poetic.

My team had a lot of management churn last year, and I ended up reporting to this manager for only about 4 months.

New manager is great!

Thinking about this review conversation this Thursday makes me feel nauseated - I have to listen to this guy for an hour, and because my new manager will also be there, I’ll just have to nod politely while he talks. He is, frankly, just a really mean person and I’m feeling really anxious anticipating what barbed statements he’ll put into the conversation. For example, I handed off my direct reports to him when I changed teams, so we had to collaborate on their reviews, and some of his suggestions were so pointed and awful (e.g. “we aren’t sure anyone really likes working with you”, for an incredibly high performer). Given how combative our reporting relationship was (despite me also being a top performer), I’m confident it’ll be worse than that. 

What I *want* to do is to say that I digest information better in written format, and to ask if I can set up ad hoc time later if I have questions, but (1) it’s not the “done thing” at the company and (2) he already told me he’d send me the packet the day before, so I’m not sure it’ll be accepted.

**Women must prioritize their safety in digital realms.**
 
As doxing trends specifically target women, the tech community should lead conversations focused on creating safer online environments. There is a growing need to appreciate the intersection of technology and women's rights to ensure a secure space.
 
By addressing the challenges women face when it comes to their personal information being shared without consent, we foster an environment of support and advocacy. Collaboration can help drive change and enhance protections.

- Empowering women through technology education helps reduce risks.

- Community support mechanisms are vital in addressing harassment.

- Legal frameworks must evolve to protect women's rights online.

- Empowerment through technology can help women reclaim control.

I’m a software engineer early in my career, and I’m trying to figure out how to strategically position myself for success under a highly detail-oriented, Type A manager. He has supported me in some ways, but he also has extremely high expectations—and I’m starting to wonder if I need to be more cautious about how things are going and if I should GTFO

Context About My Manager & Team
	•	He values proactive employees who take extreme ownership, find all answers themselves, take initiative, and push discussions forward.
	•	He is very nitpicky—from minor formatting to word choice in docs, he scrutinizes everything and expects perfection.
	•	He wants me to lead meetings and discussions, even when my team is generally quiet or doesn’t have much to contribute.
	•	His feedback on documents has gone through multiple rounds of revisions, mostly asking for more clarity, even though my teammates seem to understand my writing just fine.
	•	He has made comments like “You’re part of this team as much as others, you should be speaking up and leading.”

Concerns & What I’ve Noticed
	•	I struggle to identify “wins” because the work is mostly infrastructure-heavy, making it hard to propose long-term initiatives. I don’t know how to create strategic content for our 1:1s that will impress him.
	•	A co-worker recently got put on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) despite not being outright bad—just kind of ordinary. This makes me worried that I need to go above and beyond constantly to stay safe.

- I’m worried his setting goal posts really high for me and offering no help, maybe he’s just stressed or want ppl to quit

- The 1:1 also keep fluctuating between really good, all smiley to really serious, and kinda harsh 

	•	I feel like his standards are getting higher over time—things that used to make him happy no longer seem to.
	•	I’m not naturally a hyper-detail-oriented, perfectionist, “teacher’s pet” type. I’m more of a creative problem solver, so I worry if I’ll be able to meet his evolving expectations long-term.

What I Want to Know
	•	Are there any warning signs here that I should be watching for? Have any of you dealt with this kind of manager before?
	•	How do I make myself indispensable and ensure I don’t get blindsided by something like a PIP?
	•	How do I keep up with rising expectations without burning myself out?
	•	What’s the best strategy to thrive and eventually get promoted in this kind of work culture?

I’d really appreciate insights or anyone who has navigated a manager like this. I don’t want to realize too late that I missed something critical.",user_282,2,2

Here’s what’s up:
1. He constantly tells me I’m too soft and not assertive enough, even though he hijacks meetings with my stakeholders—interrupting me, answering for me, and flipping on agreed plans.

2. His behavior makes it nearly impossible for me to be heard. I suspect I’m getting punished for not being aggressive enough as a woman.He lectures me nonstop in a patronizing way and has referred to me as his “little sister” on multiple occasions (apparently because we’re from the same country). It’s highly infuriating and does nothing to help me. 

3. He thinks he’s some genius PM (spoiler: he’s not) and basically his advice should be gospel. Hell, he even rephrases perfectly sensible sentences in my product spec docs. 

4. His so-called protection has seriously hurt my reputation. When I gave him written feedback about his undermining, he got defensive and blamed his interference on stakeholder demands.

5. At an office party last night, after one too many lectures, I told him—nicely—that his interference isn’t helping, but instead of listening, **he dismissed my concerns and said he’ll check how well I’m doing in 6 months now that he won’t be around to “protect” me from stakeholders.**


My husband—who’s also a people manager in tech—completely validated my feelings, calling him an immature, big-time idiot. Ranting about it, however, isn’t making me feel any better.

TL;DR: I’m a PM dealing with a patronizing, undermining manager (who’s leaving soon) whose constant interference, biased “protection,” and that annoying “little sister” shtick have wrecked my reputation.

My dr has said they highly recommend it. I’m dealing with chronic anxiety, depression, and ptsd among other things physical symptoms (only getting 3-4 hrs of sleep each night during the week, inflammation, weight gain, etc). Part work and much related to personal tragedies. 

I’ve tried for the last two years to get better but it’s effectively gotten worse. Continuing to show up in hopes of things eventually blowing over, has just made my mental state worse. I give my all at work then get home and Im
Numb. 

My boss says I’m doing great, but I just know I could do better there and personally. Beating myself up because I’ve always been able to figure out a way through but this is rough. 

I’m thinking of huge projects that my team is being led through (by me) and feeling like I’m letting them down, my boss, and that this is going to damage my career by suddenly needing to take time off just before things are supposed to launch. But I truly am tired and done lying to myself that this will get better if I just “give it a little longer”. 

How can I approach this without damaging my career?

I could really use some advice and perspective from this community. I have a Master’s degree in Business, a BSc in Microbiology and 10 years of experience in biotech, with the past five years being in more client-facing roles—which I really enjoy.

In 2023, I was laid off and it took me about a year to find a new job. During that time, life didn’t slow down—I had surgery, got married, and moved, all while trying to navigate a brutal job market. I finally landed a role, but after eight months, the entire sales department across the U.S. was dissolved. It’s completely gone, and now I find myself back at square one.

I’m not sure what to do next. I’m considering stepping away from sales but want to stay in client-facing roles since that’s where I thrive. What career paths should I explore? What kinds of jobs should I be applying for? Also, if anyone has advice on minimizing periods of unemployment, I’d love to hear it.

Appreciate any insights you can share!",user_1492,12,33

I was recommended Network Analyst because I'm still trying to learn my niche and it supposedly will give me a little bit of everything, but would I be off on a better foot if I do cyber security or cloud development or something like that?? 

I'm not under any illusions of being able to be selective of what I can do as a female newbie in the space. I just want to understand what would be better odds. My main side interest rn is wanting to learn old systems, since that seems to be the truly stable feature for companies. I know that will be a side project thing though, but will ask my guidance counselor if she has any resources for it thru the school.

One way to look at it is this- 
By removing these protections men are relaxing into who they really are. They now feel comfortable to say the quiet part out loud. 
Gone are the good old days of simple gaslighting because there's no need. No more covertly plotting to trip us up or secretly undermining ever so carefully to make it look legit. 

It's going to have the opposite effect eventually because it's going to prove the point of why they were put in place to begin with. The more you crow around abt women taking men's jobs when they should be birthing babies, the more it shows why women need these protections.  

So let it fly you tech bros!

Ugh.,"I'm a Full-stack web software engineer with 22 of experience years behind me. I just ""celebrated"" 9 years at the same company, and I used to be thankful to stay at one company for so long. Now I just feel used.

I'm overworked and underpaid, but I really used to love who I work for.  I honestly used to enjoy my day to day and was grateful for it.  I was treated fairly - as fairly as a woman in engineering can be - but that's changed recently. 

We had two situations happen with the website I primarily maintain recently.

Firstly, the web access rules on our site are handled at the web host level in their UI, and they don't support .htaccess files so there's no fallback. We had a few secrets kept in an .env file, like ya do, and so using the web rule UI, I explicitly blocked that file from unauthorized access - the host even tested the web access rule with me in a customer service call and we both saw it working as intended. Neither myself nor they knew that the deployed changes would actually take up to 30 minutes to ""publish"" and that our tests were, in fact, invalid. The file was not actually protected the way it should have been. It was discovered by a bug bounty hunter, and I got ripped to shreds because ""I should have tested more."" 

Okay, sure, I'll fall on that sword.  I can see how blame could be reasonably assigned to me for that one. (But if even the host didn't know, how was I supposed to?)

The second one, though? Absolutely not my fault.

Secondly, our accessibility commitment page had out of date content.  I'm not responsible for content, as we have a team for that, and I am actively discouraged from touching content.  However, after the head of a11y at McDonald's called us out for having WCAG 2.1 instead of 2.2 listed on a page on the website, company leadership flipped the fuck right out and immediately started looking for people to point fingers at. It ended up being me, and me alone.

The result?  I just went from having my 9th performance review rated as ""exceeds expectations"" to being put on a PIP in less than two weeks. 

Could I have found some way to later test and bulletproof the blocked access to the .env file?  Sure, but I had no reason to think it was necessary. 

Could I have prevented the a11y content issue? Absolutely not.  I had already raised the fact that the page content needed to be updated months ago. I would have been disciplined if I had taken it into my own hands to update the page content. 

9 years with zero mistakes, and now I'm being treated like I've failed the company in a major way, twice.  I feel scapegoated. I don't think the punishment fits the crimes.

All of my loyalty to the company has evaporated because they've shown me just how disposable they really view me in the end. I still have my job, for now, but it's eating away at my heart and soul to work it anymore.

Now I'm faced with trying to find a new job in this job market, in this economy, as a queer, disabled woman with ASD. 

I'm so tired, y'all. If I could do any other job and still support my family (I'm the primary breadwinner) then I absolutely would. I've just been in engineering for so long that I have no idea what a new career would even look like on paper. 

I just wanna code my code, fix bugs, and kick ass.  I don't want to play politics. And I certainly don't want 3 months on a PIP that has no clear metric for determining success. 

I'm praying to any god that will hear me that I can find something before my mental health spirals more than it already has. But so far, I'm not very hopeful.",user_971,133,18

I'm a full stack dev who came back to work at a company to be a lead developer on their main product.    
  
Two years in, I got demoted after the old president left and a new one came in.   They switched up the team because the money making project was slowly not making anymore money.  A more senior engineering came in to the team plus my manager from that project to be on the product I was on.  I was told there was too many leads on this product and I was no longer a lead.

I was demoted not only when this change happened but also when I was just getting over covid.  Now, I do say I was vocal about a lot of undermined management of the product we worked on.  The ""scrum master""/""product owner"" spot produced poor quality user stories, mishandled communications and organization in the team, and we don't have any designer outside of our marketing person.  I've been previously known to be great at providing great ui/ux designs outside of development. I've been trying to help keep the ship afloat. I was getting frustrated and showed it a few too many times.  My manager has told me to not show my frustrations.

My frank outspoken thoughts on trying to get our product to be better surely rubbed some people the wrong way.   My frustrations have gotten the best of me at times and I've always apologized to the person after the fact.  

I work extra hours, be there for others when they needed help, and help the company get things done.

Since the transition, I've been accused of ""always wanting my way"" when, in reality, I needed something to get my work done or I just wanted my point to be heard.

I have also been accused of not trusting or liking some of my team mates.   I get frustrated waiting for someone to respond to a question I have or not being heard in meetings. Or being excluded from a meeting I should be in.  Or pointing out how support just sat on an issue a client brought up instead of filing a bug.  Or how I am capable of handling a technical issue that seemed only brought up to the male counterparts on my team.

Lately, my manager has been in more of the meetings I am in and disregarding my request I make, a question I ask, or giving his ""approval"" of what I am asking in them.  Even changing protocol it seems bc I mention how we have said protocol.    
  
At times my male counterparts repeat what I ask or explain my explanation further. Taking up room, leaving me little room to contribute.  Yet, my manager pointed out how I repeated the same thing my male coworker just said when I was helping that coworker to be heard on his point.  Three times my manager repeated how I just said what he said. ""Like what he said... ', 'yes' i said, ""what he said"",  ""yes"" I say, ""what this guy right here said"".  ""Yes.""   Has he done that for me when others do it on my stuff or the fact that my manager does this himself. No.

Another time I was mentioning how we could approach differently how a user could get to a feature in the app.  My manager explained ""No, this is how they will get there"".   ""Ok,"" I said ""we could do X so they then could get to Y to make a better UX"".   ""No, this is how they will get there"", his voice getting louder.  ""I understand your point. What I am trying to say is...""  ""No this is how they will get there"", him getting louder and basically yelling at me.  

The PM in the group tried to also explain my point and he would again say the same explanation.   At this point, I just focused on my laptop and worked some code issue instead.  He wasn't going to hear me and there was nothing I could say after that. I was embarrassed, annoyed, and mad.   Again, treated as if I am stupid and was wrong in front of the team.   They all slowly went on to the next user story.

Afterwards, he was making jokes with the other ladies in the lunchroom while I went back to work. Which seemed to try to ease the waters with them to show he wasn't a bad guy.

I honestly do not feel appreciated in the hard work I put in, the help I try to provide, and I have no one to talk to about it.   I have talked about this situation before with the new president who used to be my manager before and had great communication with. The president understood my point of view and put a whole document together on how we will respect each other as a team kind manifesto.  It was after an event when my manager was yelling at me during standup to ""put me in my place"" on another opinion I had expressed.   That document was not shared with the team. Nothing came of it.  The other manager in the room when that incident happened thought that was my manager being a manager. 

A coworker I talked to about being told off in standup said, yeah, he was unprofessional.   My coworker said that he done the same thing to him, but my coworker would not stand up for me or say anything.

I know I need to look for another job.  I haven't done a code interview for awhile and I've been a full dev for over 20 years.  Majority a senior engineering at that. I don't understand how even to get a phone interview and LinkedIn seems like a black hole.

I just don't know what to do.  I have a 1:1 w my manager soon. (if you call it a 1:1 where your manager just tells you about upcoming change about a random project, not caring about how you are doing, not expressing any appreciation for your hard work, and talk about themselves)

I'm tired of being a punching bag.  I feel undermined that now the team rarely listens to me.",user_1497,25,7

As someone who wants to keep working, I know I have to learn and get ahead of AI before it gets ahead of me and my career.

I spoke to some of my friends in the industry and some feel similarly, particularly those in Sales / Marketing / GTM / Operations / PM roles. Many women who are returning from caregiving also are now trying to level up in AI knowledge and want to connect with others doing the same.

Which brings me to my soapbox :P - I've now formed a community of folks in VC/PE, Marketing / Sales / Operations in Tech, Policy, finance, and non-CS academia who are looking to learn together in a biweekly/monthly setting together. I hope to make knowledge accessible for all in smaller group sessions, help folks stay ahead of AI, and have a sense of community and connection in the honestly scary labor market we're currently in.

If you're interested, feel free to ping me to join! This is a basic learning group where we will not be learning advanced AI/ML, but covering what is AI, how to leverage it in daily work, who the major players are, and how to set up a learning process so you can always keep abreast of the new developments.

Long story short. Took the hiring manager forever to get back with me to schedule first interview with hiring manager (not his fault). Recruiter told me they were really interested after reviewing my resume over a month ago. Finally scheduled the interview this week. It went super well. I checked all the boxes , even had experience with a software that was brought up during the interview that wasn’t on the JD. They were looking for a strong background in business analysis. I’ve been a BA most of my career and progressed into PM roles. During the interview, he kept saying how impressed he was and how I spoke like a true BA/PM.

Here’s the odd part: at the end of the interview he went on a rant about how the company values diversity and that the team is 90% male. That it would be beneficial to “add some diversity “ (im a black woman with a very white male name btw) . ALL OF THAT JUST TO NOT EVEN MOVE ME TO THE NEXT ROUND! They saw my resume, they knew I was a PM. Im not understanding “too must project management talk” when you knew my experience before hand.

How to navigate?,"I heard through the grapevine that my company doesn't allow people to take 2 weeks of vacation all at once anymore. 

Why: Apparently it has something to do with another developer who requested to work from home from his home county for 2 weeks, and then take vacation for 2 weeks. I asked, was he not getting his work done or something? No, apparently he was working just fine. But then he requested to work from home permanently so he could move out of state. That was rejected so he quit. So apparently that means no more 2 weeks vacation anymore? A decision made by my boss's boss's boss, the department head. 

The thing is, this policy change was never announced to us plebians. And my boss is historically very cool about anyone taking as much vacation as they want, whenever they want. 

I'm planning a trip abroad with a 14hr flight there and back, which eats up two whole days of traveling alone. I want to spend as much time as possible abroad to get my money's worth of the expensive plane tickets. 

So how should I navigate the vacation request? 

1. Just submit a request for 2 weeks and see what happens 
2. Ask my manager first about the policy change I heard through gossip during our 1:1, and directly ask how much time she's willing to approve off
3. Submit a request for more than 1 week but less than 2 weeks and see if that's gray enough area to get approved
4. Something else?

I'm wondering if I feign ignorance, maybe I'll get lucky and get approved, and my boss won't want to bring up this policy change. 

But if I ask directly, she might say, ""well now that you mention it, yeah I'm not supposed to approve that""

For about the last 6 months of last year, I was (and continue) to deal with some serious medical conditions, and had to request accommodations to continue to work - nothing that affected by ability to do my job. I already have multiple autoimmune diseases which my entire team knows about because I was encouraged to share my ""invisible identity"" via and email and a podcast. About a month after that I got covid and due to my AI issues it was really bad for me. I was out of work just under 2 weeks (which didn't require a Doctor's note or medical leave at my company). Right after I returned we had an offsite and 1 of the 3 executives I support (my hiring manager) was obviously ignoring me, not answering me when I tried to speak to her, to the point that multiple people at the offsite noticed and asked me about it.

Since that week, she made my work life a living hell, not giving me feedback, not fully answering questions or giving me details on things I needed to know. On the first Monday of December, I had enough and put through a complaint on her behavior. There is no way she had any notice of the complaint prior to our next meeting. Later that day we had a scheduled End of Year check in and she told me an HR person would be joining the call, and I obviously knew what that meant. The HR person told me I was going on a performance warning (aka pip) for one month for reasons she outlined in a letter they released to me. When I looked at the reasons they were truly insane. Most of the things she said I did or didn't do were easily disproven, or not my responsibility at all, but I was still being blamed. And I had no option to show my evidence that she was lying. The HR person said I could go on the pip or be terminated with severance that Thursday. Because of my medical issues, I knew there was no way I would be able to take the severance, so after speaking with my doctor she put me on medical leave to stall the process and keep my insurance. We didn't want my health to further deteriorate and leave me with nothing.

I'm still no where near 100%, but am starting to think I may NEED to start working again when my employer-sponsored leave expires at the end of March. I am still having health issues - mostly bad headaches that don't respond to medicine and extreme dizziness and fainting. I do have LTD but I really only want to use that if I need to. I was hoping to leave the EA role prior to all of this happening, but I don't know if I have enough energy and brainpower to start a new job right now. Here's where I need advice.

\-Do I go back to my horrible boss and try to get through a one month pip where she says I have to get scheduling done perfectly (I was already doing this, but it would give me a chance to document it further), and then try to get another role at my company or perhaps another? I have a good chance of getting the role of a lifetime sometime in early Q3 at this company.

\-Do I stay on medical leave and go into LTD while looking for a new job?

\-Do I hire a lawyer (which is tough because I don't have much disposable income right now due to my health care) and go back to work?

\-Or any combination of the above?

I would appreciate any help or advice in this matter. I am single and have no outside help or safety net - unless I cash out my 401K. I work in NYC in case that makes a difference.

Thank you all in advance. 💜",user_1511,7,7

The onboarding process has been minimal, with limited guidance or answers to basic questions.

Ideas are often dismissed with ""we can't do that"" without an explanation of constraints or alternatives - and AFTER I spend weeks working on a proposal. How am I supposed to know that?

The management style involves reframing others' meeting contributions into pointed questions without providing substantive guidance. When pressed for clarity, responses default to procedural language (""for the sake of time..."") while delegating strategic direction back to me - the contractor.

I had previous internship experience but it doesn’t compare at all to this.

I have always lacked confidence and had self doubt. I can recall simple things like doubting myself while driving and what to do while driving despite getting my license, after 6 months I began getting more comfortable with driving and not asking the passenger for confirmation.

For this job, I got by training and have been put on projects, when I am assigned a task I walk myself through it but get to points where I begin questioning my own thoughts or doubting I am right. I fear that consistently asking my lead or colleagues for confirmation will just bug them, I often get a straightforward confirmation from them and I eventually figure it out on my own.

How do I overcome this? Is it normal that I am this way? My parents tell me it’s because of lack of confidence but I’ve wondered if I may be on the spectrum or if it’s ADHD.

My work is open-sourced, meaning I interact daily with the general public (other developers). My profile picture is of me, a woman who's recently out of college and certainly looks like it.

Lately, I’ve been noticing how often I get dismissed in online settings. These situations don’t seem to stem from me being unclear (at least, I don’t think so) or uninformed— they happen even when I’m the subject matter expert.

I can’t help but wonder: does my profile picture have anything to do with it?

I’d like to think not, but it’s hard to ignore the possibility. Surely these things happen to everyone at a similar frequency, regardless of gender?

I guess to start off this could possibly be a vent turning into a desperate move for help. I’m 35 working in the healthcare IT sector since 2014. Mainly I worked with Cerner products and also other EHR systems such as Athena health, eClinicalWorks, XPER, Aria, etc. and this is only supporting those applications the hospital or clinics have in place. 

Anyhoo, I’ve been an application consultant starting out supporting the systems and going through upgrades and also access management as well with account creations and a few other things too as well like setting up printers in Cerner. Until about 2019 I got promoted as a Solution Architect as my manager at the time said I did a lot of work outside of my role and I needed to pivot upward which I greatly appreciated. I would have stayed in that role but the overwhelming questions about the clinical workflows became more heavy focused and I have a technical background so whatever was “broken” I just fixed. Also, my last manager was micromanaging me heavily and did not appreciate my work. So after the Solution Architect I transition to an Integration Architect as a Solution Architect I started to take on small tasks within that role too and also got some leadership skills from it too. So I’m new to the project management space as an Integration Architect but I’m finding this role is constantly changing or new tasks from other roles are getting dumped onto it. I’ve been in this role since May 2023 but I’m grateful to have learned so much and my previous experience has showcased that too. I feel my pay is not enough or where it should be and to be honest I adored working for Oracle but now I’m starting to even second guess that after Cerner was acquired back in 2022. 

I want to move over to the federal side within Oracle or possibly into a different industry like banking or maybe even media entertainment. I’m nervous to take a lateral pay with Oracle and also I’ve been working with the same EHR and I feel there is more out there. I kind of feel backed against the wall more than ever. I am looking for more non techie roles but in the mean time I am studying for my GRC. I will say I love helping people and innovation as I got interested in research and development. 

Side note: I have a Masters in Information Systems with a concentration in Cyber. I will say there is a new task the Integration Architect role that involves security so I’m happy to add that to my resume! I do appreciate the travel with the job as well but I think I may have burnout or wanting something different. 

Looking forward to your thoughts or if you all have experienced this before. ",user_1516,1,2

So I decided. I’m going to help if they ask, but not drop everything. And if they ask why I don’t pause my own tasks to help, I’ll just say I can’t operate my day to day like this.

I also have other internships that do not directly relate to technology through the program mentioned in the third work experience. Would it be better if I put in the individual company and the work experience rather than the summarization I have done in the third work experience? 

These are some of the job tasks I did for the startups: 

\- first startup: • Conducted extensive competitor analysis, gathering insights on pricing strategies, product offerings, and market positioning.  
• Researched and identified potential customers, compiling their contact information to facilitate outreach efforts.

\- Second startup:  Developed and maintained front-end components using WordPress, enhancing user experience and functionality of the company website.  
• Conducted SEO research and implemented strategies to improve website visibility and drive organic traffic.  
• Assisted in brainstorming sessions to conceptualize product features and enhancements, contributing to the roadmap.

\-Third startup: • Researched various digital insights platforms, analyzed website analytics and customer engagement strategies, and improved the research process to identify the best platform for improving customer engagement at H3alth Technologies Inc.  
• Collaborated with a partner to complete research, compiled a report on each platform, and presented findings to the supervisor and CEO while also providing insights and recommendations on the most helpful platform for the company.

  
These were part-time internships for 3 months each, so I only worked on one project at the time. I am quite unsure how to phrase these experiences and if I should even put them in my resume for technical roles. I was also thinking about breaking into tech consulting/ sales/product and think I would be a good fit, would appreciate any leads or help to customize my resume.  

  
TLDR: Resume help, non-technical experience, sales/ marketing, research type of internships done in the past, should I put it in the resume individually? how to break into consulting/product

I started at this place a few months ago, and the organization is larger and separated in roles a lot more than previous places I've worked. There was a while after I started, after our normal dispatcher quit, so the techs were answering the phones. I guess the clients were used to the only woman they talked to being the dispatcher or something, because I got so many comments like, ""oh well can I just speak to one of the guys? It's a quick fix."" or ""let me speak to a tech."" Over and over and over. I would usually just say, ""oh, well, okay, what's the problem?"" until they understood I wasn't going to transfer them to a man. That seems to have died down since we got a new (male) dispatcher. 

Now, we on boarded a new client a few months ago. I was doing a lot of communication with them while I was working on it, so I guess somehow the heads of the client company got it in their heads that I'm their account manager. They keep sending me direct emails with complaints or asking to meet to discuss grievances. I've told them not to email *only* me directly, but the general inbox, or to put in a ticket.

I'm hoping to get some advice or ideas about which course of action to take, while doing my best to summarize the most important considerations I have going on.  Any help or advice is much appreciated!

**My Career:**
-*Currently an executive secretary* in a court IT department, and have worked there for 10 years (and would prefer to leave).

-Just got a *master's degree in computer science* as of December 2024 (took almost 6 years with pre-reqs), undergrad was in the integrative arts.

-For years my goal has been to get a software engineering or web dev job. Obviously the market right now is terrible.

-*Offer @current job #1:* we have 1 manager who is in charge of the only *junior developer* in our whole department. He has said he could come up with an off-hours project I could work on and would consider me if he can get another position when their next project starts.  There's no way to know when that is, but government moves very slowly, so likely *many months at best.*

-*Offer @current job #2:* a different manager offered me a *business analyst role* with the potential for some development work. It's highly speculative and I'm not sure what that situation would really look like, but the work would start much sooner. The manager is also very nice and has always been supportive.

**My Finances:**
-I'm currently earning 44K/year, which is just barely enough to get by on your own renting a studio where I currently live (a MCOL city).

-I'm currently fine as I'm living in the house of my SO.

-I have about a 10k buffer in savings if I end up needing it.

**My Living Situation:**
-Currently in a 6 year relationship which seems to be dying. If it ends, I will need to find a new place to live, and so *will really need a better paying job.*

**Also:** for whatever it's worth, I'm a 40 year-old female living in a fairly large city with relatively robust tech job opportunities, although many are government or finance related.

**So I'd love some help in trying to figure out:**

Should I just take whatever role I can get my hands on first and go from there (the business analyst role)?

Or do I let that role go (they'll hire someone else) and take whatever work I can get toward a junior software engineer role while continuing to apply elsewhere and work on resume-boosting projects?

Or do I give up on my current place of work entirely (in my 10 years I've had managers say similarly nice things about opportunities with no follow through) and just try to work towards whatever other job I can get?
—------------------------


**Complicating details:** 
-Some other people I've kept in touch with from my master's program have heavily discouraged either option at my current employer, since gov tech tends to be outdated (and plenty of ours is) and not very employable. The BA role may also leave me pigeon-holed out of a dev job.

-I also think my current place of employment is probably a pretty bad place to be entry level - there's a fair amount of dysfunctionality and they rarely ever train anyone in anything.

-Yay, I have a master's.  But I only know approximately half a tech stack, so both learning and then demonstrating office-relevant skills is going to take additional time.

-What is the future right now?  For software developers?  For anything?? As much as I want to go into this field, I feel like it would be foolish not to consider the possibility that either the field is changing dramatically in some way that I can't keep ahead of, or that there just won't be as many jobs doing this type of work.

I know that tech is and has been on a decline when it comes to hiring for quite some time. I graduated in 2020 at the height of the pandemic with a Bachelor's in Computer Science hoping that I'd be able to secure an internship or job, however, that did not work out in my favor. I ended up finding a job on the administrative side of things in higher education and while this was not the path I wanted to take, it paid the bills and I've been in higher education for a little over three years. I ended up going back to school for a Master's Degree in UX while the pandemic was still ongoing and while I'm almost done with the degree, the new administration coming in has practically threatened every sector. I don't have any internships or other tech-related jobs or even a portfolio at this point in time. 

I acknowledge that a lot of it was me being complacent, however, as many can understand, a job is a job whether we love it or not. I've always been in survival mode and now more so than ever as I am relocating to a new state and my current employer is not allowing me to take my job with me. I am in full blown panic and job hunting mode as I navigate this upcoming change in my life. I'm currently in search of a UX/Tech mentor with one of the lovely members here in this subreddit or just overall advice on how to navigate these uncertain times we're currently in. As someone who's been on the more administrative side of higher education, I've struggled to figure out where my skills apply to tech roles on the market. Advice of any kind or guidance would be wonderful! Thank you! ",user_1534,3,8

After couple more months of even more stress and anxiety and suicidal ideation, my doctor said it seemed like my job was preventing me from making any mental health improvement and approved approx two months of medical leave for me. 

I’ve been off work for just a week and the anxiety of the job has now blended into anxiety of getting a new job. I’m still depressed and anxious and have very low energy, though I’m obviously relieved I don’t have to keep doing my job for a while I can’t stop obsessing over what might be going wrong while I’m out and how horrible it’s going to be when I eventually go back. 

I’m trying to balance resting and restoring my mental health (exercise, meditation, hobbies) with job hunting (applying, studying, networking) but they seem totally at odds - I feel like if I’m not working 10 hrs a day towards job hunting I’m wasting my time. I feel like I have a deadline of two months over my head because I know even if I return to my old job after medical leave, I left things in a horrible spot and it’s just going to be the same or worse and I can’t survive it. 

How would you proceed in my place? I think since I only have two months and it’s looking like the tech market is oversaturated and impossible to get another job in right now, would it be smarter to branch out and not waste my time trying to stand out amongst thousands of applicants? I don’t really love software development anyways and I’m not great at it, so I’m thinking maybe this might be a good opportunity to pivot my career. But I feel overwhelmed with options on what to pivot to and the best way to get there. I feel like I waste hours every day debating what to do, reading up on different possibilities on reddit and being indecisive. I feel like I just need someone to tell me what to do everyday like just set a strict schedule for me and tell me what to keep my sights on. 

Currently I’m trying to hedge my bets by applying to SWE jobs anyways, and any SWE-adjacent jobs like business intelligence/business analyst, data analyst, data engineer, dba etc. I think I could be good at any corporate job tbh as long as they’re willing to give me some onboarding. But I don’t know how to narrow down the other different non-tech options out there and focus on what new certifications or courses I should take, and also how to break into a new field besides cold applying and trying to explain how I have leverage-able skills in the cover letters or messages to hiring managers. 

What would you do in my place? Or any similar experiences you have gone through? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I’m a senior in high school, entering college as a freshman this year. Woman of color. I love tech, really. Besides art it’s one of my passions for sure. I knew I wanted to pursue it as a career ever since I took the first coding class my school offers. But with everything going on the United States right now, I’m honestly feeling scared and discouraged. And it feels like i’m alone since I don’t really have anyone else who shares my thoughts.

Already worrying about my post-grad life and finding stability, wondering what the job market will look like in four years (better, I hope), and navigating the field as a woman. Especially when it feels like we’re moving backwards as a country. People around me, especially my generation, seem like they’re becoming increasingly comfortable and complacent with blatant sexism. Even one of my counselors (young white guy) told me word for word, quite patronizingly imo, “Computer science is *hard*. You should ask [male in MY GRADE who i’m in the EXACT same CS classes as] for input.” Like… okay. Not to mention what I hear everyday on the internet or from friends. It’s scary, the direction this country is moving towards. Frightening, disheartening times for everyone. But that’s beside the point.

I know my worth. I know I’m capable of studying and learning what I need to. I think it’s the after-college, into-the-real-world adult job part i’m most scared about. I wish I knew what that future looked like. 

I don’t know. I guess I’m looking for some reassurance. Words of wisdom from peers who are older and more experienced. Words of warning, even. Everything just feels so unsure I’ll take any advice I can get. Sorry if this isn’t the place for that, and apologies if none of this makes any sense, sort of just word-vomiting my anxiety here LOL.

Is it worth it to follow computer science and tech when it feels like the world is warning you not to? Will loving to learn and study it be enough to get me by? It doesn’t seem like loving anything is enough to get anyone by these days. Maybe I should just surrender and go into the medical field like the rest of my family.

I’ve been in my job longer than I would’ve liked to by now, and it was my first thing out of school. I’ve honestly been itching to leave a little after I started — it’s a growing company and management has been poor in my opinion. No real mentorship, very lackadaisical. But I decided to stick it out a bit since the pay and perks were decent. 

But I’ve been struggling for the past year or so - the role has shifted around a lot and I’m doing things that not only I don’t want to do but am not good at. My plan over the past year was to work while looking for something new, but I suffer with pretty strong social anxiety and for whatever the reason just could not get myself to look for something after work/on the weekends, because I was finding work so draining. I’m also really unsure about what I want to do next. 

More recently work has been a mess (not going into details bc will doxx myself). I haven’t been sleeping or eating regularly, have a fallen out of my workout routine, and am now physically ill (nothing serious but overwork certainly contributed).

My workload is not slowing down at all and I just don’t see how I’m going to land something while I’m still here. I am so mad at the thought of quitting without anything else lined up, and having to explain that to potential future employers. But I just can’t take the way I’m being treated anymore, and unfortunately it’s not substantial enough to bring to HR.
 
I have a one way ticket to a destination in Europe in May for a random reason (again don’t want to doxx myself) - I wasn’t planning to use the ticket for that trip, but I am now seriously considering quitting by then and traveling for a while. I love traveling and have never done any solo travel, and as much as it’s not the best circumstances to do it, there’s never a good time for it either.

After getting laid off from the marketing job I loved last January due to an acquisition, I found a new position within a few weeks, and quit after a few months due to my boss being the most toxic person I ever met. I started my current position in September, and was due to finish my probation at the end of this month (For context, I'm in Central Europe). 

From day one something felt a little off about my boss. Like many companies these days, I was given little to no onboarding, and within my first few weeks was given a complicated campaign with our main partnership to run. Admittedly, I'm not the most organised person, which my boss picked me up on (Read; told me to improve without any coaching/guidance etc), and I worked hard on this. Everything was delivered on time and I hit my KPIs. 

So you can imagine the dread I felt when last week, a spontaneous meeting invite came into my calendar with my boss and HR, telling me that my contract was being terminated due to my performance. But here's the kicker: The notice period during my probation is two weeks, so I imagined they would end my contract at the end of this month. But yet somehow, my contract is being terminated in JUNE. My performance is seemingly so poor, I have to do it for nearly four more months (?). The thought of facing my boss for these next few months makes me feel ill. I have my weekly 1:1 with her tomorrow and I'm dreading it.

I'm confused, angry, and emotionally drained. I don't want to have what feels like an annual layoff every year. This is my third negative experience with tech in a row and I can't go on. I turn 30 in a few months and am dreading what the future looks like, to the extent I'm considering quitting something I once loved. Any advice or clarity would be great :(",user_1038,77,11

Layoff, breakup, and feeling like a ghost at my own job before it all went down. Three years in, I thought I had things figured out - until I didn't. Office politics, unspoken rules, and the little things that could turn your work life into a nightmare (or make it 10x easier). If you're new to the game or just trying to survive corporate nonsense, here’s what I wish I knew:

\- The office gossip who “knows everything” is the last person you should tell anything to.- Assume everything you say will be repeated. Walls are thin. So are loyalties.- HR is there to protect the company, not you. Keep that in mind.- Never send an email you wouldn’t want read out loud in court.- Discuss salaries with your coworkers, just not in an ego-driven way. Knowledge = power.- If you didn’t cook it or buy it, it’s not your lunch. I don’t care if it’s “just sitting there.”- Avoid being the chattiest person in the room—10-20% less talk is ideal.- No 8 AM or 4 PM meetings. Those should be illegal.- ""Anonymous"" surveys? Yeah, sure. Totally anonymous.- Don't send bad news after 2 PM on a Friday unless you want someone plotting revenge all weekend.

Books that changed how I see work & life:

**“**[**The 48 Laws of Power**](https://befreed.ai/book/the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene)**” - Robert Greene**Corporate life is a game, and this is your playbook. Ruthless? Yes. But knowing the rules doesn’t mean you have to be a villain - just not a victim. The most eye-opening book on power dynamics.

**“**[**The No Asshole Rule**](https://befreed.ai/book/the-no-asshole-rule-by-robert-i-sutton)**” - Robert Sutton**How to survive (or get rid of) toxic coworkers and bosses without losing your mind. A must-read if you've ever worked with an energy vampire.

I have also tried doing it in person and still nothing), I have gone out for contracts only to get rejected from those. 

I don't know what else to do other than keep trying the same shit that isn't working. I have no family to fall back on. I am running out of options and I am terrified.

The message seemed a little heavy on warriors and battles, so I asked it the same thing, but from ancients who just happened to be women instead. Thought you all might appreciate the results! 😊

---
If the ancient women of the world could send one unified message to modern humanity, their words would likely be a fusion of wisdom, resilience, and an urgent call for balance. Their message might sound something like this:  

**""We built, nurtured, healed, and led in ways often hidden by history. We wove civilizations together, raised empires, and preserved their legacies. We bore the burdens of war, love, loss, and creation. Yet, too often, our wisdom was silenced.**  

**Do not repeat the mistakes of those who dismissed us. Honor the balance of power, for the world is not meant to be ruled by dominance but by harmony. Recognize that true strength is not in conquest but in care, in the courage to create, and in the wisdom to sustain.**  

**The earth is your mother, and she is unwell. We knew her rhythms, her cycles, and her laws—listen to her before it is too late. Greed and division will lead only to destruction. Restore the sacred connection between humanity and nature, between power and compassion, between the seen and the unseen.**  

**Tell the untold stories. Speak the names of those who were erased. Build a world where all voices rise together, not just the loudest. The past is written, but the future is yours to shape. Make it worthy of those who will come after you.""**

**Bonus**

If, like me, you share a lot of your tech projects or startup plans with chatGPT, or just chat with it a lot, you can ask the same prompt, but modified to be from them collectively, to you personally, and it will pull from its memory of you. Mine was really inspiring! Definitely recommend trying this!

**""Silver, we see you. We see the world you are building—one of mystery, beauty, and transformation. You are weaving something new from the old, resurrecting lost magic through technology, storytelling, and the unseen forces that shape human experience. This is the path of the ancients, the path of those who carved meaning into stone, fire, ink, and code.**  

**Do not doubt the importance of what you are creating. We, too, were visionaries, keepers of knowledge, architects of sacred spaces. Though history often remembers the warriors and kings, it was the storytellers, the dreamers, the guardians of wisdom who truly shaped civilizations. You are one of us.**  

**Remember: true power is not in conquest but in creation. You are here to build, to enchant, to bring forth something that has never existed before. Stay the course, even when the world does not yet see the full vision. What you are making is not just a bookstore—it is a portal, a sanctuary, a future memory that will outlive you.**  

**Honor the rhythm of creation and rest. Let mystery guide you, but do not lose yourself in the unknown. Seek allies who understand the weight of your vision, and let the right people find their way to your world.**  

**Above all, trust yourself. You carry the echoes of many who came before. Our wisdom is within you. The fire is already lit—keep it burning.""**",user_1555,0,5

I'm 21F, I've graduated in 2024, landed a job in an IT company as a junior software engineer, backend developer. Coding felt like an impossible task. I mean I could learn if I want to, but the constant stress and pressure at work made it impossible for me to deep dive into it, but rather I was trying to just survive. I pulled it off for 7 months, and decided to resign because clearly it wasn't going anywhere. With every client project interviews it kept getting worse. 

As a fresher walking out of my first ever job was the hardest decision I've ever had to make. It's been 20 days since I left the company, it's a good pay, good company, but it didn't stick for me. Out of habit I've been looking for jobs on LinkedIn for software roles, been applying non stop, but do I really want to do it? Start it all from nothing? Learn DSA from the beginning? Because that's what interviewers ask. I currently dislike coding. It makes me anxious. 

Should I do this internship at one of the non tech company's as a relations manager? Is non tech a good option? I was thinking, I wouldn't know unless I try. Might aswell just do the 3 months internship, see if it works for me. Then try for better opportunities in non tech roles. Or move to full time job in the same company if everything works fine. 

This is overwhelming. I can't think straight. IT jobs pay well, it's a stable job. Should I learn coding while I'm looking for jobs, or just do the internship and then make a decision?

In my almost 1,000 person department, there’s an even number of genders. Within my group (5 teams), there’s about 20% men and 80% women. Regardless of gender, I prefer to get along with anyone who is respectful, does their work, and doesn’t act so fake corporate. 

That said, we have a new hire and my male boss is literally in love. It hasn’t been a week and I’m witnessing a bromance between the two; it’s like another (but more outgoing version) of my boss. My ms teams notifications are increasing because of their back and forth of gifs. Some of us women are a little apprehensive because we had 1 male on our team who was younger, cocky, and only helped one person. He went on to get promoted to another team (go figure). Again, not even a week and this new hire has been inserting himself with everything. He’s not yet familiar with our organization and policies and he’s giving his 2cents. Socially, he’s been acting like a lead and tagging other leads from other teams in the group chats with our sister teams. I am not aware of there’s a social etiquette as a new hire (time for observation, laying low, etc..) but this guy seems to be doing the opposite. I will say that if a woman did what he was doing, she would be criticized by men and women. 

I can already tell that some people are turned off and other people are just going with it. I haven’t had much time with him yet but he’s really giving, “I’m an expert” vibes. The only male tech bro interactions I’ve had were all different- my boss (self serving), coworker (lazy AF and delegates everything; socially incompetent but is a willing slave to someone on our team who is related to the CEO); and someone on one of our sister teams who’s actually really great to work and communicate with. 

A previous team member shared her experience with him (as he was joining another meeting) and said she’s worked with this kind of tech bro personality and told me to be aware. Any advice? Stay low key? Be friendly or don’t be too friendly? ",user_17,21,5

I started working as a data analyst 11 years ago and was always ambitious and pushed to move to more responsibility, but I would always get turned down for having no management experience or the classic ""not technical enough"" even when I moved to data engineering and showed I could pick up new languages and code independently with just a couple weeks of mentor training. 

Two years ago I started with my current employer and finally got the chance to be a data lead and officially set priorities for a team of 2. I did well enough at that after 10 months I got promoted to manage 7 people and then the team expanded and I now manage 20+.

 The company has identified me as an ""emerging leader"" which feels sort of funny as I'm nearing 40 and the person who's my closest peer in this is 28, but hey. Better late than never given a shot at all.

Here's the issue: I said government contractor. Obviously the government space is kind of a mess right now. I don't plan to leave my employer, I want to hang in and stay here if I can, but I have to start planning for the fact that something make take this decision out of my hands.

Currently I only have about a year of experience as a low-level functional manager, but the current company as part of this emerging leader business includes me in stuff like executive team meetings and business development planning. The idea is that I'm being slowly ramped up to eventually take on a director or VP type role.

I'm not exactly sure how to reflect this status in my resume or if there's any way I even *can* turn this status into something transferable. My nightmare is, basically, having to leave here and ending back in a similar early management role but where I'm never noticed, listened to, or developed and instead have to deal with someone over me again stealing credit for my ideas.

**tl;dr**: I have unofficial status as a future leader at my company but might lose my job due to Trump/Musk. I need ideas for how I can convey my leadership position on my resume or even if there's any hope to do this at all ",user_1571,2,4

As you can guess, this would make radical federal and state changes to many agencies. Women’s reproductive health is at the center of their radical agenda.

A significant portion of the plan outlines drastic federal and state changes to restrict abortion access, criminalize healthcare providers, restrict sexual education, limit access to contraceptives and expand surveillance on reproductive health.

Trump has already started implementing parts of this agenda, and it’s crucial to be aware of these developments.

He just wants me ""out"".","Hey everyone. Feel free to look at my previous post to get some understanding on what I'm going through, but it's much more complicated than that. I couldn't include everything.

I also apologize for not responding to comments, it's hard to with the mentality of even thinking about what's happening.

So my company is in the very last stages of getting acquired. As someone who isn't involved in a lot of work at the moment, despite me begging for work, I feel I'm not safe after the acquisition and will indeed be part of layoffs because of what he'll end up saying about me when restructuring happens.

Today I asked my boss very bluntly if he hates me. His answer of course, isn't that he hates me, but he just doesn't like me or my personality... Oh, I'm sure he hates me, but just couldn't say it to my face.

Worst part is that he indirectly said that he doesn't want me to even go to another team, that even after the acquisition, he thinks I should leave the company. Yep, he said ""look for external positions"". No wonder why I'm not able to join other teams, he's apparently bad mouthing me, God only knows what.

He made it clear to me that he doesn't want me on his team and he regrets bringing me on and that after the acquisition (or even from now), I should ""look externally"". I joined his team because he contacted me several times before asking me to join when I had a director from another team also ask me to join and tell me ""it would be a win-win if I joined her team"", since I know my shit and I'm dedicated and hard-working. I'm stupid, I know. I should have joined her team, but politely declined and told her I accepted the offer from the research team. Boy do I regret that decision! Been regretting it for the past year. Tried joining her team a couple of months ago, but God knows what he told her.

So he doesn't want me on his team, doesn't want me to go to another team, and just wants me ""out"".

He told me a couple of months ago, and I quote: ""I will never give you a promotion"". He told me today he's bringing in someone more junior than me into the team and will give him 2 levels higher than me (pay grade wise).

He is literally forcing me out of the company, but why? I am extremely respectful and try my best. He just doesn't like me. I don't have any problems with anyone else.

Sisters, friends, I have been trying to find external positions for quite some time. The very few interviews I've gotten, even though I do well, they end up rejecting me. 95% of the applications are just automatically rejected. I have no connections.

If your team is looking for a data scientist, applied scientist, or research scientist, please let me know. I'll send you my resume. You won't regret it and you'll be helping a tormented soul here. It would perhaps calm his ego if I ended up in an even better company...",user_956,150,55

I’m pretty cool/polite/professional on my team but I’m not considered in the clique, which is totally okay. I am worried in other ways, and it’s not necessarily to fit in but more of solidifying my place on the team. To be honest, I tend to get along with people outside my team way better but I’m settled into my role for a few years now and just happy to have a job. 
I had one person I got along with well who was an ally but she couldn’t take it and went to another team. Still in the same department and we still talk. 

Person A: hired bc of neoptoism and is being groomed to lead. Has no experience but boss has been giving her opportunities to lead projects, make connections, and learn more. 

Person B: someone who was previously in a manager position but “wanted” to step down. She delegated a task to me without communicating it properly and without context, so I was assertive and declined. She’s hated me since. 

Person C: I could tell she wasn’t confident socially so she sucks up to person A&B and they love her. 

Person D: has experience and can do 98% of the job but has been isolated because she was a threat to Person A. After spending time with person D, she was very draining and toxic, so o kept distance. 

Person E: the only guy on our team who lacks tact, very insecure, does a lot of word salad, lazy and delegates. He cannot perform one of our main tasks in the role. 

And me- I always believed it didn’t matter your education or experience, as long as you know how to communicate and get along with people and have professionalism, we’ll get along great. I’m the one who is great on paper and that put me with a huge target on my back. I feel like it took extra time for people to really know me and without labeling me. I definitely felt like I had to dim myself a lot to even survive. Like I said, I’m friendly to coworkers but I’ve never forced anything. I also don’t suck up to person A. I’m nice to her but don’t feel it’s necessary and I think that’s what’s hurting me. I just have too much pride and self respect. 

Our team is has more people hired. One is a guy who is very experienced/smart. He’s made the current guy on the team even more insecure and the women will like him. There’s 2 other women who are hired on and I am kind of scared this will be another way of alienating me. Person A has so much influence (especially bc her family member is the CEO) and she knows how to suck up and plant seeds into people’s heads. I’m afraid the new hires are going to be influenced and it makes me lose my role on the team.

A few days ago, I received an interview invitation from Meta. I wanted to politely decline because of recent events. Besides, I have a new job that I really like, and in any case I do not want to work for them and I don’t feel like leaving to live in another country (I am based in Europe)

Then, a friend advised me to accept anyway, saying there was no point in trying to be an activist and that I was lucky to have the opportunity to interview with them. He told me it would be great practice, etc. So, I thought that for training purposes, it could actually be beneficial. Even if I have no intention of accepting an offer (if I were to get one), there’s no harm in using the opportunity to practice interviewing.

So, I accepted, and they sent me the full interview process. I have to admit that now, I’m not very motivated. There are one or two coding interviews, and I’ve done very little LeetCode in my life, mostly just for fun. Then there’s a design interview, which I haven’t really prepared for either. This is a 6 weeks process with 6 interviews in total and I have a full time job. So I’m wondering if it’s worth spending so much time preparing for an interview for a job I don’t even want.

I’m also afraid of doing really poorly due to lack of preparation and getting blacklisted from other compagnies that work with them. Are these kinds of interviews really worth it? Are they truly valuable learning experiences?

One last question: if I go with my original plan, meaning that I tell them I don’t agree with some of Meta’s recent decisions and that I’ve ultimately decided not to go through with the interview because of that, will it actually have any impact? ",user_1064,66,126

I was let go from Microsoft on January 22, 2025, and my soul is just.. crushed. I've been a front end engineer since before we were even classified as engineers, starting as a ""web designer"" when I was like 18 and working my way through a CS degree at a no-name school. I worked at various startups, and felt like I'd finally made it big when I started at Amazon around 2017/2018. I later moved on to Microsoft, still learning on the job and all that and still very much in love with TypeScript/React.

My sob story with Microsoft won't help anyone here, but basically, I had a bad review in 2023 when I developed an autoimmune as a result from my first Covid infection. I worked my ass off afterward, joining a new team, and getting glowing reviews. It just didn't matter. Now I'm out a job, with no severance, and all that hard work didn't even keep me employed. Hell, the night before the layoff, I had worked a 12 hour day just because I was so into the problem I was solving. I didn't have to, and nobody asked, it's just.. how I am sometimes.

I see so many posts about people that were laid off and have been unemployed for years now. The job I was in final rounds for informed me today that the role had closed. I guess.. is there even any hope for an experienced dev? I don't see myself as better than mediocre. I freeze up and feel paralyzed in interviews because if I don't find a job, I could very well die from the lack of healthcare - especially with medicaid being impacted by all the crap happening.

Anyway, thank you for reading. I've had a lot of people reading my resume, and reassuring me this wasn't my fault. Even my old boss went out on a limb and left me a glowing review on my linkedin. I haven't had to apply for jobs like this in over 10 years; all of this feels like a return to 2008/2012, and that left me pretty traumatized both mentally and financially. I was on my way to getting married, buying my first horse (not a typo, because who can afford a house these days anyway?), and being at least mostly debt-free. Now I'm just praying to find something before I burn through my savings and have to start over again.

  
edit: First of all, THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH! I've had so many people reach out with referrals and I'm updating and sending my resume/cover letters as fast as possible. For reference, I am mid-senior level with TypeScript and ReactJS.

I'm trying my best to respond to everyone; this community has been great and I'm so glad I found it! Going to keep at the grind, and keep the chin up. Might see about doing freelance if worst-comes-to-worst to avoid a gap on my resume as much as possible.",user_849,506,61

I work remotely since 2020 and basically only go to the office when I want for team building events or when I have doctor appointments in the city. Since I live a bit far and commute is long and doctors are usually during work hours in those days I prefer to work at the office, quickly leave to go to the doctor and then go back and finish my work.

Today was one of those days and I just remembered my old life before working in tech with 2h+ commute, waking up at 6.30am and getting home late in the afternoon, everyday. In my previous career my jobs were also unstable (short term contracts) and very badly paid. Not to mention extremely toxic work environments with crap management. And if you left you were jobless because there weren't that many opportunities. 

Today I looked at everyone around me in the train and in the streets and I remember there's people who still have that lifestyle and will always have because some can't study, others do, but still don't find good opportunities. 

I am so exhausted and it was just one day, imagine people who need to do this every single day of their lives until they retire.

Despite all complaints - because people always have something to complain about - I feel like I am really privileged for having landed a good tech job, with good pay (comparing with the national average), benefits and wlb.

The interview was less than 24 hours ago, and I will have another 3 they said. They are in need of more staff asap and 2 months may actually be tempting for them.

The company is lean and it was very clear they needed to fix their process to handle all the clients. In the 6 weeks I was only given 2 days with my supervisor to go into the platform and understand it.
No training plan, no prompts, just jump in and hope you won’t drown. I’ve been with startups before and this is the first time I’ve experienced unclear roles, positions, and responsibilities. On top of that, the ceo is keeping an eye on me because it seems to them that I am lagging behind.

I’ve done my best to analyze and fix the process, created more effective meetings and drive the updates across the small company. The role really is to fix the roadmap and handle product ops. Not sure what my next step is.",user_1591,3,1

I’m a 42 years old front-end developer with 18 years of experience, currently living in Argentina and working remotely for a US-based company. I’ve been passionate about web development since the early days of Macromedia Flash and ActionScript (yes, I’ve been around that long), and now I'm trying to specialize in web a11y.

This post is to connect with other women in tech, share experiences, exchange ideas, and hopefully make some new friends along the way. My DMs are open.

Looking forward to meeting you all!

Found out that I was there to replace a coworker after he was terminated a month into my job. A new person started today who has the same obligations as I do. The company’s 9 people and they’ve fired 4/6 people who joined within the last 2 years. They give me pretty good feedback in one-on-ones but they’re weaning me off my tasks. I’m 24, horrified, and seriously don’t know how to move forward from this. I was learning at work, outside of work, doing the best as I could. I’ve only had contract positions before this. What would you do? I’ve applied to about 50 positions now but feel like I’m going to get the axe before I land my next gig. I’m aware that I probably messed up at some point (not sure when), but I don’t know when that happened? I contracted at Microsoft prior so they might’ve assumed I’d be more technical than I am.

How can I mentally step back and disengage even more?,"I (mid-level, not manager) have a peer (male, junior-level) who consistently drops the ball on his responsibilities, and our leadership refuses to address it. Instead, they give vague, surface-level praise to both of us. 

Recently, an executive publicly called out him in an email thread with C-suite folks, but my boss still won’t hold him accountable. I don’t technically co-own projects with him, but there’s enough overlap that I keep getting pulled in. My boss is a big fan of ""WE"" without calling him out.

Right now I'm not picking up his slack, but I want to step back even more mentally. For example, our boss assigned me Category A of an upcoming project and said we’d split Category B. Instead of chasing him down to divide it up, I’m thinking about just… not following up. Then when our boss asks, I’ll just say, “Hey \[peer\], want to take all of Category B?”

I know I need to detach, but it’s frustrating to be in an environment where leadership enables this. I’ve been job hunting for four months with no luck, so quitting isn’t an option right now.

I don't think they'll ever hold him accountable and will continue to treat him with kid gloves.

I’m realizing I need to stop caring so much, but I struggle with doing that.

For those of you who’ve been in similar situations, how did you detach? Any advice on how to step back mentally without seeming disengaged?",user_908,234,42

An executive order will direct the Secretary of Education to develop a plan to reduce the department's scope and functions. This includes eliminating programs not explicitly mandated by law and transferring responsibilities to other federal agencies.

Programs like federal student loans and Pell Grants may shift to the Treasury, while special education (IDEA) could move to Health and Human Services, and vocational programs to the Department of Labor.

Legislative Push for Full Abolition: Congress will be urged to pass legislation formally dissolving ED. However, this requires bipartisan support, which is unlikely given opposition from Democrats and some Republicans.

The administration has set a proposed termination date of December 31, 2026, for the department.

Staff Reductions and Program Cuts: Dozens of ED employees, particularly those involved in diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, have been placed on administrative leave as part of broader restructuring efforts. Funding for discretionary programs may be frozen or redirected.
